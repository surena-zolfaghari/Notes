Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover
any motion of the earth relatively to the “light medium,” suggest that the
phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties
corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has
already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of
electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the
equations of mechanics hold good. 1 We will raise this conjecture (the purport
of which will hereafter be called the “Principle of Relativity”) to the status
of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently
irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty
space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the
emitting body. These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and
consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell’s
theory for stationary bodies. The introduction of a “luminiferous ether” will
prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not
require an “absolutely stationary space” provided with special properties,

Let us take a system of co-ordinates in which the equations of Newtonian
mechanics hold good. 2 In order to render our presentation more precise and
to distinguish this system of co-ordinates verbally from others which will be
introduced hereafter, we call it the “stationary system.”
If a material point is at rest relatively to this system of co-ordinates, its
position can be defined relatively thereto by the employment of rigid standards
of measurement and the methods of Euclidean geometry, and can be expressed
in Cartesian co-ordinates.
If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the values of
its co-ordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear carefully in mind
that a mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless
we are quite clear as to what we understand by “time.” We have to take into
account that all our judgments in which time plays a part are always judgments
of simultaneous events. If, for instance, I say, “That train arrives here at 7
o’clock,” I mean something like this: “The pointing of the small hand of my
watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.” 3
It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending the defini-
tion of “time” by substituting “the position of the small hand of my watch” for
“time.” And in fact such a definition is satisfactory when we are concerned with
defining a time exclusively for the place where the watch is located; but it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events occurring
at different places, or—what comes to the same thing—to evaluate the times of
events occurring at places remote from the watch.
We might, of course, content ourselves with time values determined by an
observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the co-ordinates,
and co-ordinating the corresponding positions of the hands with light signals, given out by every event to be timed, and reaching him through empty space.
But this co-ordination has the disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the observer with the watch or clock, as we know from experience.
