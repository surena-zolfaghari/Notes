Now consider two particles, with electric charge $q_{e1}$ and $q_{e2}$ , as well as magnetic charges $q_{m1}$ and $q_{m2}$ . Repeat the analysis
of Section 6.12 of Jackson to obtain the change in the angular momentum of particle 1 (when particle 2 is held fixed) and
show that

$$\dfrac {\mu_0(q_{e1}q_{m2}-q_{e2}q_{m1})}{2\pi\hbar} \in \mathbb{z}$$
