## How to symlink?

 What? symlink or a Symbolic Link is simply enough a shortcut to another file.

ln -s /opt/zotero /home/surena/.local/share/applications
```
The first address is the `zotero.desktop` for program maybe there is in program and you can access to it after extraction, sometimes you have to create it. And second address is local that usually put such file there to create icon.
