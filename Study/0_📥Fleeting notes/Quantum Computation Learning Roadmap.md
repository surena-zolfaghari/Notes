Quantum computation is a fascinating field that has been rapidly growing in recent years. If you're interested in learning more about it, here's a roadmap to help you get started:

## 1. Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

To understand quantum computation, you first need to have a good understanding of quantum mechanics. You should start with the following resources:

- [Quantum Mechanics for Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1826E60FD05B44E4) - a series of lectures by Dr. David Albert from Columbia University that provides an intuitive introduction to the concepts of quantum mechanics.

- [Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Computation-H-Klauder/dp/0195102708) by John R. Klauder and Bo-Sture Skagerstam - a comprehensive introduction to the theory of quantum mechanics and its applications to quantum computation.

- [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965) by Noson S. Yanofsky and Mirco A. Mannucci - an introduction to quantum computing that is accessible to computer scientists without a strong background in physics.

## 2. Quantum Algorithms and Applications

Once you have a good understanding of quantum mechanics, you can start to explore quantum algorithms and their applications. The following resources are a good place to start:

- [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176) by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang - a comprehensive introduction to quantum computation and its applications, including quantum algorithms for factoring and search, quantum error correction, and quantum cryptography.

- [Quantum Algorithms via Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Algorithms-via-Linear-Algebra/dp/0521871573) by Richard J. Lipton and Kenneth W. Regan - a detailed introduction to quantum algorithms that emphasizes their mathematical structure and their connections to classical algorithms.

- [Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Introduction-Eleanor-G-RIeffel/dp/0262015064) by Eleanor G. Rieffel and Wolfgang H. Polak - an accessible introduction to quantum computing that includes a discussion of quantum algorithms and their applications to optimization, simulation, and machine learning.

## 3. Quantum Hardware and Experimentation

Finally, to fully understand quantum computation, you need to learn about the hardware and the experimental techniques that are used to implement quantum algorithms. The following resources are a good place to start:

- [Quantum Computing Hardware](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030362574) by Ryan LaRose and Mohammad Amin - a comprehensive introduction to the different types of quantum hardware, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and topological qubits.

- [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176) by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang - includes a detailed discussion of the experimental techniques that are used to implement quantum algorithms, including quantum error correction, quantum tomography, and quantum process tomography.

- [Quantum Information Processing with Superconducting Qubits: A Primer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0220-1) by J. Koch and D. I.

- [Quantum Information with Rydberg Atoms](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3017) by M. Saffman - a review of the use of Rydberg atoms in quantum information processing.

## Additional Resources

In addition to the above resources, there are several other resources that can help you learn more about quantum computation:

- [Quantum Computing Report](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/) - a news and information site that covers the latest developments in quantum computing.

- [Quantum Open Source Foundation](https://qosf.org/) - a community-driven organization that aims to promote the development of open-source software for quantum computing.

- [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) - a cloud-based platform that allows users to experiment with real quantum hardware and run quantum algorithms.

- [Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/) - a community-driven Q&A site where you can ask and answer questions about quantum computation.

- [Quantum Information Science and Technology Roadmap](https://www.nitrd.gov/PUBS/Quantum-Information-Science-and-Technology-Roadmap-2020.pdf) - a report by the US government that outlines a roadmap for the development of quantum information science and technology.

## Conclusion

Quantum computation is a complex and rapidly evolving field, but with the resources outlined above, you should be able to get started on your journey to understanding it.
