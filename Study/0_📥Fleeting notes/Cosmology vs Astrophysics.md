# Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is a type of electromagnetic radiation that pervades the entire observable universe. It is a remnant of the Big Bang, the event that marked the beginning of the universe, and is considered one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the Big Bang theory.

The CMB is often referred to as the "afterglow" of the Big Bang because it is the oldest light in the universe, dating back to about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Before that time, the universe was too hot and dense for light to travel freely, and the universe was filled with a dense, opaque plasma. 

As the universe expanded and cooled, the plasma recombined into neutral atoms, allowing light to travel freely for the first time. The CMB is the light emitted by this newly-formed, transparent universe.

The CMB is a nearly uniform glow of microwave radiation that fills the entire sky, with small fluctuations in temperature and polarization that are thought to be the seeds of the large-scale structure of the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The CMB has been studied extensively by cosmologists and astrophysicists, and has provided important insights into the early universe, the formation of galaxies, and the overall structure of the cosmos.

The temperature of the CMB is currently about 2.73 Kelvin (-270.43 degrees Celsius or -454.81 degrees Fahrenheit), making it one of the coldest things in the universe. The temperature fluctuations in the CMB are very small, on the order of one part in 100,000, but they contain a wealth of information about the early universe, including the density and distribution of matter and energy, and the nature of the primordial fluctuations that gave rise to the large-scale structure of the universe.
