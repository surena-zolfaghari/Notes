As a second example we consider the radial null geodesics of Schwarzschild spacetime. For $\mathrm{d} \theta=\mathrm{d} \phi=0$ the Schwarzschild line element reduces to
$$
\mathrm{d} s^2=-f \mathrm{~d} t^2+f^{-1} \mathrm{~d} r^2=-f\left(\mathrm{~d} t-f^{-1} \mathrm{~d} r\right)\left(\mathrm{d} t+f^{-1} \mathrm{~d} r\right),
$$
where $f=1-2 M / r$. The displacements will be null if $\mathrm{d} s^2=0$. If we define
$$
u=t-r^*, \quad v=t+r^*,
$$
where $r^*=\int f^{-1} \mathrm{~d} r=r+2 M \ln (r / 2 M-1)$, we find that $u=$ constant on outgoing null geodesics, while $v=$ constant on ingoing null geodesics. The vector fields
$$
k_\alpha^{\text {out }}=-\partial_\alpha u, \quad k_\alpha^{\text {in }}=-\partial_\alpha v
$$
are null, and they both satisfy the geodesic equation, with $+r$ as an affine parameter for $k_{\text {out }}^\alpha$ and $-r$ as an affine parameter for $k_{\text {in }}^\alpha$. (Check this.) As their labels indicate, $k_\alpha^{\text {out }}$ is tangent to the outgoing geodesics, while $k_\alpha^{\text {in }}$ is tangent to the ingoing geodesics. The congruences are clearly hypersurface orthogonal. Their expansions are easily calculated:
$$
\theta= \pm \frac{2}{r}
$$
where the positive (negative) sign refers to the outgoing (ingoing) congruence. Show we also have
$$\dfrac{d\theta}{d\lambda}=-\dfrac {2}{r^2}$$

Let $k_\alpha^{\text {out }}=-\partial_\alpha u$ show this satisfy null geodesic equation in Schwarzschild space-time
