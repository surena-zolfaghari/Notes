$$
\Gamma_{c a b}=e_c^\gamma e_{a \gamma ; \beta} e_b^\beta .
$$


The connection used here is the one defined by Eq. (3.28), and we would like to show that it is compatible with the induced metric. In other words, we would like to prove that $\Gamma_{c a b}$, as defined by Eq. (3.28), can also be expressed as
$$
\Gamma_{c a b}=\frac{1}{2}\left(h_{c a, b}+h_{c b, a}-h_{a b, c}\right) .
$$



Equation (3.27) then reads
$$
A_{a \mid b}=A_{a, b}-\Gamma^c{ }_{a b} A_c,
$$
and this is the familiar expression for the covariant derivative.

It is easy to see, by continuing in this way, that all symmetric derivatives of the connection vanish at the origin in Riemann normal coordinates. Some authors take this to be the definition of Riemann normal coordinates. I prefer the definition given at the beginning of these notes as it has a nice geometric feel to it.
There are two series expansions that we will use frequently. The first is an expansion of various objects, such as the metric, in powers of $x^\mu$. The second expansion arises by constraining this first expansion to points on a typical geodesic. Each such expansion will give us some useful relations between the metric, the connection and the Riemann tensor.
3.1. Metric

Consider a Taylor series expansion of the metric around the origin $O$, namely,
$$
g_{\mu \nu}(x)=g_{\mu \nu}+g_{\mu \nu, \alpha \beta} \frac{x^\alpha x^\beta}{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^3\right)
$$

There is no linear term because $g_{\mu \nu, \alpha}=0$ at the origin. It is a simple algebraic exercise to show, given (3.2) and (3.3), that
$$
\Gamma_{\alpha \beta, \nu}^\mu=-\frac{1}{3}\left(R_{\alpha \beta \nu}^\mu+R_{\beta \alpha \nu}^\mu\right)
$$
$-3-$
