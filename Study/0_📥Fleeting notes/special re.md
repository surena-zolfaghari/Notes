The three components of spatial momentum P i together with the energy
P 0 form a 4-vector.
This has the important implication that the energy and momentum get mixed up
under a Lorentz transformation. For example, an object at rest in one frame has
energy but no momentum. In another frame the same object has both energy and
momentum.
Finally, th







# 3.5.3 An Example: Positronium Decay
Now that we know how to write down the energy of a massless particle, we
can solve a simple but interesting problem. There’s a particle called
positronium that consists of an electron and a positron in orbit around each
other. It’s electrically neutral and its mass is approximately the mass of two
electrons
