# Derivative Transformation
Created:2024-04-21 10-31

Transformation is straight forward because as I said the derivatives are vectors, and you can transform basis and components vector as we did for basis and component vectors earlier.

Now we use a new notation to showing basis.

## Why are derivatives operators vectors?

We introduced basis vectors as a derivatives operators. It's clear in flat space, but maybe you can appreciate this notation in curved space. So first of all we have to pay curved space.

## Curved space

To calculate velocity, we need position vector, in order to position vector, we need origin. But there is couple of things:

There is no straight line anymore:

So the position vector digging and the go out of surface:

## intrinsic geometry

In General relativity space is curved, so we can't draw straight lines in the curved space. That means we can't draw position vectors and we can not pick an origin point outside 4 dimensional space time, because that would mean we pick in point outside of universe and I don't know is there such point or not ... .





We can't draw straight line, we can still draw curved pass.

So we use intrinsic geometry. and use curve. <mark style="background: #2BE611A6;">and define increase in $x$ direction and this notation is $\dfrac {\partial}{\partial x}$.</mark>
