Review of Tensor calculus.
vectors are column vectors like$\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 1\end{array}\right)$,and  covectors are row vectors like : $(\left.\ 2,3,3,4\right)$.

Tensors are combinations vectors and covectors.

# Transition matrix

I define two basses: old basis:$\left\{e_1, e_2\right\} \quad$and new basis:$\left\{\tilde{e}_1, \tilde{e}_2\right\}$. The relations between them are
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\tilde{e}_1=2 e_1+1 e_2 \\
\tilde{e}_2=-\frac{1}{2} e_1+1 / 4 e_2
\end{array}\right.
$$

Change of basis matrix (transition matrix) is $\left[\begin{array}{rr}2 & -1 / 2 \\ 1 & 1 / 4\end{array}\right]=F$

This matrix changes old to new. So if you multiple this matrix with a vector in old basis, It gives you a vector in new basis.

Now how will changes the components of a vector? inverse!

Imagine
It's clear each component of new basis is twice of old basis and each component of $V$ new basis is half of the component of $V$ in old basis.

Now let's pay to covector. I said vectors are column vectors and convectors are row vectors. Notice Convector is not about transpose.

# part two


So what is covector really? Think them as a function. They take vector and get a scalar.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \alpha: V_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} . \\
& \underbrace{{\left[\begin{array}{ll}
2 & 1
\end{array}\right]}}_{\text{covetor}}\left[\begin{array}{l}
3 \\
4
\end{array}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

## Covector Component
Vector components of $2 e_1\; +\;1 e_2$ are $2,1$. Co-vectors are function, they don't live in vector space. So define $\epsilon^1, \epsilon^2$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon^2, \epsilon^1: \;& v \mapsto \mathbb{R} \\
\epsilon^{\prime}\left(e_1\right)=1 \quad& \epsilon^{\prime}\left(e_2\right)=0 \\
\epsilon^2\left(e_1\right)=0 \quad& \epsilon^2\left(e_2\right)=1
\end{aligned}
$$
$\epsilon^1, \epsilon^2$ are basis of co-vectors. and pay to corrector components.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \epsilon^1(v)=\epsilon^1\left(v^1 e_1+v^2 e_2+\cdots\right)=v^{\prime} \\
& \alpha=\alpha_1 \epsilon^{\prime}+\alpha_2 e^2 \quad\text { s.t } \quad\alpha_1=\alpha\left(e_1\right),\; \alpha_2=\alpha\left(e_2\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

## What are $\epsilon^1, \epsilon^2$ ?

## what are components?

Note: vector component are measured by counting how many each basis vectors are used in the construction of a vector.

Note: Convector components are measured by counting kew the number of covector lines that the basis vector pierces.


Example, $2 \epsilon^{\prime}+3 \epsilon^2$
