# Bound states and Scattering states
Created:2022-12-05 15:23
We have encountered two very different kind of solutions to the independent time equation. The solutions of the first group (infinite square well and harmonic oscillator) are normalizable and labeled by a discrete index $n$. The second group's solutions are non-normalizable and labeled with continuous variable $k$. 
The former represents realizable states in their own right, but latter don't. The linear combinations satisfies Schrodinger equation. Therefore for first group we have summation and for latter integral.

## What's the difference and distinction?
In simple language, if particle trapped in potential, we say bound state. And if the particle be enable to escaping, we call scattering state. 
Everything come to $E$ and $V(x)$. If $V(x)$ be grater than $E$, the particle are bounded. If $E$ exceeds to $V(x)$ on one side (or both) the particle can come in from infinity and speed down or speed up under the influence of the potential and returns to infinity. It depends on potential shape.
Some potentials like harmonic oscillator only admits bound state and some of them just admits scattering potential. Another group can be either bound states and scattering states coincidentally.
