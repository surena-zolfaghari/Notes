# # Event horizon in general relativity


An event horizon is a hyper surface separating those spacetime points that are connected to infinity by a time-like path from those that are not. what we mean by "infinity." 

we use infinity as a proxy for "well outside the black hole," and imagine that spacetime sufficiently far away from the hole can be approximated by Minkowski space.
