## Max Born vs Schrodinger & Albert

Schrodinger thought that $\Psi$ represents particles that disintegrate You have a wave function, and the wave function spread all over space. So the particle has distinguished completely

> More $\Psi$ $\rightarrow \;$More particle is there

Max Born solved S.E for a particle that hits a coulomb potential then they found the wave function falls off $\dfrac {1}{r^2}$. "But we did experiment, the particle choose a way and it goes one way and when you measure it, you get the full particle. particle never disintegrate", Mar Born said.

Max Born said $\Psi$ doesn't tell how much of the particle $m$ at $x$ at time $t$, But rather what's the probability to find it at $x$ at time $t.$

> $$ \boxed{dp(x,t_0)=|\Psi(\vec{x},t_0)|\;d^3x}$$

within cube

Probability of find at $x$ at time $t_0$, within cube.
