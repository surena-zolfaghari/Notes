As you will see in future, the bases of a ket are $|E_1\rangle,|E_2\rangle, |E_1\rangle,\ldots$ . Now we pay the following question. how big is a basis?
$$|\psi\rangle=c_1|E_1\rangle +c_2|E_2\rangle+c_3|E_3\rangle+\ldots$$
If it's finite, it's OK! How about infinite bases? 
The problem with that is the summation can be outside of vector space. For instance, we know the polynomial form a vector space and $x^0, x^1,x^2,x^3,\ldots$ are basis vector. They organize a
