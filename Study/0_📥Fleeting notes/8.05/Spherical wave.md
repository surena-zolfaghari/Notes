When writing equations of waves, you will often see them written in complex exponential form, because this can make it easier to perform algebraic manipulations on the wave. The equation for a spherical wave is the following:
$$
u(r, t)=\frac{A}{r} e^{i(\omega t \pm k r)}
$$
$u(r, t)$ is the value of the wave at a particular point in space, $r$ and time, $t$. $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $k$ is the wavenumber.
When the time comes to plot the equation, we use only the Real part of the equation. Rewriting the above equation with Euler's formula gives us:
$$
\begin{gathered}
u(r, t)=\frac{A}{r}(\cos (\omega t \pm k r)+i \sin (\omega t \pm k r)) \\
\Re[u(r, t)]=\frac{A}{r} \cos (\omega t \pm k r)
\end{gathered}
$$
