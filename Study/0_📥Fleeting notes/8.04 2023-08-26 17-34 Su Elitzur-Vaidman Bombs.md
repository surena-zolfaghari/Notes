If detector detects photon, bomb will explode. Now suppose after years, does work this bomb? Notice you can't access to detector and check it.

Elitzur and Vaidman asked:
> Is there a way to certify that the bomb is working without exploding?


And with certainty in classical physics is impossible. If either you do measurement to see. if detector works, and if it works your lab goes off.

There is a way out. Put bomb in Mach-Zender interferometer.
