If detector detects photon, bomb will explode. Now suppose after years, does work this bomb? Notice you can't access to detector and check it.

Elitzur and Vaidman asked: Is there a way to certify that the bomb is working without exploding?


And with certainty in classical physics is impossible to answer this question. If either you do measurement to see. if detector works, and if it works your lab goes off.

There is a way out. Put bomb in Mach-Zender interferometer.

suppose the bomb defective:
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline \text { Outcome } & P \\
\hline \begin{array}{c}
\text { photon at D0 } \\
\text { no explosion }
\end{array} & 1 \\
\hline \begin{array}{c}
\text { photon at D1 } \\
\text { no explosion }
\end{array} & 0 \\
\hline \text { bombexplodes } & 0 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

and the bomb is good:
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline \text { Outcome } & P \\
\hline \begin{array}{c}
\text {bomb explodes } \\
\end{array} & \dfrac {1}{2} \\
\hline \begin{array}{c}
\text { photon at D0 } \\
\text { no explosion }
\end{array} & \dfrac {1}{4} \\
\hline \begin{array}{c}
\text { photon at D1 } \\
\text { no explosion }
\end{array} & \dfrac {1}{4} \\
\hline
\end{array}$$


But here's the catch.

Yes half of the bombs exploded, we're sorry about that, But if the bomb doesn't work. There is no way a photon can reach to D1. Because. if a photon doesn't work, all photon go to D0. $(8:40)$

$25 \%$ time reach D1 implies that photon is at D1 and bomb. doesn't explode, but bomb is good.

Bomb is working with $25\%$ efficiency. We can raise efficiency to $50\%$. And If you put the bomb in cavity, a resonant Cavity, with photons going around. you can reach $99\%$ efficiency.
