Created:2023-08-13 23-00

In 1925 -> Schrodinger & Heisenberg -> wrote down QM equations. However QM is started in early 19 century



Quantum mechanics is really a framework to do physics. and correct the description of fundamental theory. CM Is a good approximation, but we know that at some point, It's not quiet right

Quantum physics is the principles of QM applied to different physical phenomena. For example quantum electrodynamics  which is quantum mechanics applied to electromagnetism. 

Quantum chromo dynamics which is quantum mechanics applied to strong interaction.

Quantum optics which is quantum mechanics applied to photons.

Quantum gravity which is quantum mechanics applied to gravitation :))) 3:19



and that's what gives rise to string theory is presumably a theory of gravity and in fact the quantum theory of all interactions, If it's correct. Because not only describes gravity, it describes all other forces

So Quantum mechanics is a frame work.

- Necessity of Complex number
- ﻿﻿﻿Loss of determinism
- Superposition Unusual
- Entanglement

# Linearity

When You have a theory, Yow have some dynamical variables.

These are the variables you want to find their values because they are connected with observation
