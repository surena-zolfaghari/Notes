Free particle with momentum $p$ associated to a plane wave with wavelength $\lambda=\dfrac {h}{p}.$ So This wave is what eventually becomes a famous wave function. 

When you have waves, like electromagnetic waves, you have polarization, you have directional properties, the electric field points in some directions. Is there a same property for the wave function? Yes.

But it has to do with spin. When the particles have spin, there are directional properties of the wave. and typically you use several wave functions that corresponds to directional components of this wave.

Photons are spin 1 particle, electrons or spin $\dfrac {1}{2}$ particles so there will be directional properties to it.
