If $E_1$, electric field also $E_2$, $E_1 + E_2$ is electric field. But in quantum mechanics is very strange. I want to show in couple ways:

# Mach- Zender interferometer (1891-1892)


Scheme of beam splitter.

what is Mach-Zender interferometer?

They did this before they realized they're photons.

Now you know from QM, Some photons go up and some photons down or some strange. If you have a super position some photons may go both up and down. So that's what can happen in quantum mechanics.

In classical mechanics, If you send a beam, BS divides half up and half down and there is interferometer at BS2. And we can design this interferometer such sometimes everything at D0, and Sometime at D1.
