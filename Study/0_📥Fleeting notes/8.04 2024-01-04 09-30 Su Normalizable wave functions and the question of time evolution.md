#  Normalizable wave functions and the question of time evolution

$$i \hbar \dfrac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x, t)\right) \Psi(x, t)$$
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Psi^{*}(x,t)\Psi(x,t)dx=1 \tag{1}$$

Suppose the wave function has well-defined limits as $x \to \pm \infty$. If those limits are different from zero, the integral around infinity would produce an infinite result, which is inconsistent with the claim that the total integral is one. Therefore the limits should be zero:
$$\lim_{x \to\pm\infty}\Psi(x,t)=0$$
Maybe you say "I have the wave function is so crazy that it can be integrated, but suddenly it has a little spike and it just doesn't have a normal limit." We will assume that this situations are not happened. You can not Prove it's a necessary condition, but if it holds, it simplifies many many things and essentially, if the wave function is good enough to have limit, then the limit must be zero.

The other thing that we will want
$$\lim_{x \to\pm\infty} \dfrac {\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x}< \infty$$
