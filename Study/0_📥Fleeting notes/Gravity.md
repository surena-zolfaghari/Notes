find its energy-momentum tensor.



We found that in the weak field limit $g_{00}=-1-2\phi$ this is true only in four spacetime dimensions. By using
equation:
$$\dfrac {1}{2}\epsilon \square(h_{\mu \nu}-\dfrac {1}{2}\eta_{\mu \nu} \eta^{\rho \sigma} h_{\rho \sigma})=-\kappa_n T_{\mu \nu}$$
for $\epsilon h_{\mu \nu} = g_{\mu\nu} - \eta_{\mu\nu}$ where $\square = \eta^{\mu \nu}\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}$ show that the non-relativistic weak field limit of Einsteinâ€™s equations in an
n-dimensional space ( n + 1 spacetime dimensions) reads $$\nabla^2g_{00}=-2 \dfrac {n-2}{n-1} \kappa_n \rho$$


Use the variational principle approach to find the field equations of the theory (considered by A. S. Eddington)
$$l = \sqrt(-g)R^{abcd}R_{abcd}$$
