## Harmonic Oscillator
why does he first pay attention to Brute force method?

Weâ€™ll encounter some of the same strategies in the theory of angular momentum (Chapter 4), and the technique generalizes to a broad class of potentials in super symmetric quantum mechanics (Problem 3.47; see also Richard W. Robinett, Quantum Mechanics (Oxford University Press, New York, 1997), Section 14.4).


# Chapter 3
Quantum theory is based on two constructs: wave functions and operators.
$$|\alpha\rangle \rightarrow \mathrm{a}=\left(\begin{array}{c}a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_N\end{array}\right)$$
The set of all square-integrable functions, on a specified interval. constitutes a (much smaller) vector space (see Problem 3.1(a)). Mathematicians call it $L^2(a, b);$ physicists call it Hilbert space.3 In quantum mechanics, then: Wave functions live in Hilbert space. We define the inner product of two functions, f (x) and g(x), as follows:
$$\langle f \mid g\rangle \equiv \int_a^b f(x)^* g(x) d x$$
**and the collection of square-integrable functions is only one example of a Hilbert space**
