In physics, the terms "rest mass" and "mass" refer to different concepts, and there has been a historical shift in the way these terms are used due to advances in our understanding of particle physics. Here's an explanation of the old convention and the new convention:

Old Convention:
In the old convention, "mass" referred to what is now called "rest mass." Rest mass is the mass of an object when it is at rest relative to an observer. In this convention, mass was considered an intrinsic property of an object, and it was thought to be an absolute quantity that didn't change with an object's motion. This concept was introduced by Isaac Newton in his laws of motion and was used extensively in classical mechanics.

In this old convention, the mass of an object remained the same regardless of its motion. For example, the mass of a car on the highway was the same as the mass of the same car at rest in a parking lot.

New Convention:
In the new convention, the term "mass" is reserved for what is often referred to as "relativistic mass." This concept emerged with Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity in the early 20th century. According to special relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, its relativistic mass increases. This means that the mass of an object in motion is greater than its rest mass.

In the new convention, the rest mass (sometimes simply referred to as "mass") is considered an invariant property of an object, meaning it doesn't change with velocity. It's the mass of an object as measured when the object is at rest relative to the observer. The relativistic mass concept is less commonly used today, and instead, the rest mass is the preferred way to describe an object's mass.

To summarize:

    Rest Mass: The mass of an object when it is at rest relative to an observer. This is an intrinsic property and is the same in both the old and new conventions.
    Relativistic Mass: The mass of an object as it approaches the speed of light. This concept was used in the old convention but is less commonly used today, as it can lead to confusion and is not necessary in most modern physics applications.

In modern physics, the distinction between rest mass and relativistic mass is clear, and the rest mass is the preferred concept for describing an object's mass.
