When kets are labeled by vectors, operators go in or out of the ket without change. If the ket labels are not vectors, the above identification is not possible. Imagine a non-degenerate system where we label the states by their energies, as in $|E_i\rangle$, where $E_i$ is the value of the energy for the $i$th state. Acting with the momentum operator $\hat{p}$ on the state is denoted as  $\hat{p}|E_i \rangle$. It would be confusing, however, to rewrite this as $|\hat{p}E_i\rangle$ since $E_i$ is not a vector. It is an energy, and $\hat{p}$ does not act on energies. 

Bras are rather different from kets, although we also label the

The wave function associated with a state is formed by taking the inner product of a position state with the given state.  Given the state $|\Psi \rangle$ of a particle, we define the associated position state wave function $\Psi$ by
