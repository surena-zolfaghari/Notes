When kets are labeled by vectors, operators	go in or out of	the	ket	without	change.	 If	the	ket	labels	are	not vectors,	the	above	identification	is	not	possible.	 Imagine	a	nondegenerate	system	where	we	label	the	states by	their	energies,	as	in	| Ei⟩,	where	 Ei	is	the	value	of	the	energy	for	the	 ith	state.	 Acting	with	the	momentum operator	 	on	the	state	is	denoted	as	 	|Ei⟩.	It	would	be	confusing,	however,	to	rewrite	this	as	| 	Ei⟩	since	 Ei is	not	a	vector.	It	is	an	energy,	and	 	does	not	act	on	energies. Bras	are	rather	different	from	kets,	although	we	also	label	the
