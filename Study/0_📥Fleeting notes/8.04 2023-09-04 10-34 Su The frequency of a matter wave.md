#  The frequency of a matter wave
Created:2023-09-04 10-34
We spoke about $\lambda$. What is the frequency of a matter waves?
de Broglie did the answer:
$$p=\hbar k$$
$$E=\hbar \omega$$
$$\therefore \quad\omega=\dfrac {E}{\hbar}$$
And complete the story.

$$V_{\text {phase}}=\dfrac {\omega}{K}=\dfrac {E}{P}\overset{\text {non relatvisitic}}{=} \dfrac {\dfrac {1}{2}mV^2}{mV}=\dfrac {1}{2}V$$
It's the velocity in which the nodes and maxima of this plane wie

So If I have a particle with $E,\; p$, $E= \dfrac {1}{2}mv^2$, $p=mv$. and now seems the wave is moving half the speed of particle!

$$\text{!That looks pretty bad!}$$

## What's going on? 
###  Phase velocity is not meaningful,
This is the usual story with waves. If the wave itself doesn't a plane wave, carries no real information. It's not a signal. So many times when you try to represent the particle or a little bit of information traveling representing it with a <mark style="background: #2BE611A6;">plane wave</mark> is actually wrong. <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">You have to represent it with a wave packet</mark>

$$V_{\text{phase}} = \dfrac {1}{2}V$$
- This wave is very strange
- phase velocity isnot very meaningful physically

## What's meaningful? 
###  group velocity is meaningful

$$V_{\text{group}}= \dfrac {d\omega}{dk}|_k=\dfrac {dE}{dp}=\dfrac {d}{dp}(\dfrac {p^2}{2m})=V$$

And This equality is the reason people did believe de Broglie. Actually it's true relativistically as well. Put $p$ and $E$ relativistically and this answer comes out exactly the same.
