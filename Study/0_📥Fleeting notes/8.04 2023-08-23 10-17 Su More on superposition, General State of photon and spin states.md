Physical assumptions: If you have a state and you superimpose it to itself, you have not do anything.
$$|A\rangle \equiv 2|A\rangle \equiv -|A\rangle \equiv i|A\rangle$$

It's a physical assumption, can we test it?

حالا شاید بگی چه معنی داره؟

We can make some sense of this assumption at this level? We can do it on states of light. we spoke about 2 photon ploraized. Along the $X$ axis an $Y$ axis. These are two quantum mechanical states.

Now suppose to form general photon state:
$$\alpha \;|photon,X\rangle+\beta \;|photon,Y\rangle \tag{1}$$


How many parameters does this state have? 4 real, 2 complex

You think about polarization state can be expressed with 2 real numbers, and this assumption helps. By multiplying $(1)$ to $\dfrac {1}{\alpha}$
$$\dfrac {1}{\alpha} (1) \; \Rightarrow \;|photen,X\rangle + \dfrac {\beta}{\alpha}\;|photen,Y\rangle $$

$\dfrac {\beta}{\alpha}$ = 1 complex number

Thanks to this assumption!
