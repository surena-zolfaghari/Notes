I spoke about surprising measurement with photon. Now I want to back by thinking about photons as physicist did one hundred years ago and come up with quantum mechanics.

The photoelectric effect (An experiment by Herz 1887)

After releasing photo electron, you get photoelectric current.

## Four properties of photoelectirc

1. Polished metal plate irradiated may emit electrons
"Photo elections" $\Rightarrow$ Photo electric current.

2. There is a threshold frequency $\nu_0$? Such that only $\nu > \nu_0$, there is a current.

> $\nu_0$ depends on the metal and configuration of atom at the
surface.



3. Magnitude of the current proportional to the light intensity

4. Energy of the photo electrons independent of the intensity of the light



$(3,4)$ $\Rightarrow$ The number of photo electrons would depend on the intensity of light, but not the energy of photo electrons.
