# The photoelectric effect

I spoke about surprising measurement with photon. Now I want to back by thinking about photons as physicist did one hundred years ago and come up with quantum mechanics.

The photoelectric effect (An experiment by Herz 1887)

After releasing photo electron, you get photoelectric current.

## Four properties of photoelectirc

1. Polished metal plate irradiated may emit electrons
"Photo elections" $\Rightarrow$ Photo electric current.

2. There is a threshold frequency $\nu_0$? Such that only $\nu > \nu_0$, there is a current.

> $\nu_0$ depends on the metal and configuration of atom at the
surface.



3. Magnitude of the current proportional to the light intensity

4. Energy of the photo electrons independent of the intensity of the light



$(3,4)$ $\Rightarrow$ The number of photo electrons would depend on the intensity of light, but not the energy of photo electrons.



How does increase energy $E$?

$E_{e^{-}}$ increases linearly with the frequency of the light. photoelectric is not easy to understand if you think of light as a wave.

Einstein came up with an answer. that he almost said what was going on. He said the light comes in bundles of energy. And in a beam you have bundles of energy quanta, did not quite say light is a particle.

Einstein (1905): light is composed of quanta (photon,actually photon is a word by chemist Lewis in 1920) with energy 
$$E = h\nu$$

$$W \equiv \text {work function} \equiv \text {Energy needs to release an electron}$$

Work function depends depends on: metals Structure, how well you have polished the surface.

$$E_{e^{-}} \simeq \dfrac {1}{2}mv^2 = E_\gamma - W = h\nu - W \quad\text {Einstein's prediction}$$
$E_\gamma \equiv \text {Energy of photon}$

It wasn't obvious increases linearly (I marked above). Measurement of the energy of emitted particles was not all that easy either.

The experimental confirmation took 10 years to come. It was verified by Millikan in 1915.
