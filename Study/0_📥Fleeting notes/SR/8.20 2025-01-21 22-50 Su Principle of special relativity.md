Einstein developed the theory of special relativity based on two principles:


1. **Principle of relativity:** All inertial frames are equivalent and the laws of physics have the same form. There is no privileged inertial frame.

2. **The Principle of the Constancy of the Speed of Light**: The speed of light is always constant, independent of wavelength, the speed of the observer, or the speed of the source. No speed can exceed the speed of light.

These two principles were also formulated and published by Poincaré several months before Einstein. In addition, he derived the Lorentz transformations. However, there was a fundamental difference between Poincaré’s work, as a highly respected mathematician and physicist, and Einstein's approach. Poincaré recognized that, as a result of these two principles, absolute simultaneity of clocks would be disrupted. However, he regarded this as a coordinate effect, not a physical reality dependent on the properties of space and time, as Einstein claimed.


Today, we know that these two principles are not independent. In fact, the principle of the constancy of the speed of light follows from the principle of relativity.
