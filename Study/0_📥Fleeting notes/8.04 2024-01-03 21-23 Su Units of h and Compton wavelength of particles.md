# Units of $h$ and Compton wavelength of particles 
Created:2024-01-03 21-23

Remember $\hbar c=200 Mev.fm$ 

## Units of h
> $$[h] = \dfrac {[E]}{[V]} = \dfrac {ML^2/T^2}{T}= \dfrac {ML^2}{T} = LM \dfrac {L}{T} = [r][p]=[L]$$


That's why when people talk about a particle of spin $\dfrac {1}{2}$. They say the angular momentum is $\dfrac {1}{2}$.

With every constant, we can introduce new quantity:
> $$[h]=[r][p]$$

Now consider a particle with mass m. We can associat a length to it. How?  like rah $r=\dfrac {h}{p}$ is de Brogle wave length. But it's another way.

Suppose this particle is just not moving and you have the momentum. What's going on here? Think of it at rest and than you say. you can still construct a length
$$r=\dfrac {[h]}{[p]} \rightarrow \dfrac {[h]}{[mc]}$$

> Compton wavelength of the particle $\neq$ de Brogle wavelength

you don't have to tell me what's the momentum. you know just the mass and it has a length associated to it.

Why would it be important? It will be important in 2 different ways, through an experiment and through a thought experiment.
