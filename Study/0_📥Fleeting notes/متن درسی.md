The curve for which $\ell$ is an extremum is determined by substituting the 'Lagrangian' $L\left(\dot{x}^\mu, x^\mu\right)=\left( \pm g_{\mu \nu} \dot{x}^\mu \dot{x}^v\right)^{1 / 2}$ into the Euler-Lagrange equations,
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} \lambda} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}^\alpha}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x^\alpha}=0
$$

Show that $x^\alpha(\lambda)$ must satisfy the differential equation
$$
\ddot{x}^\alpha+\Gamma_{\beta \gamma}^\alpha \dot{x}^\beta \dot{x}^\gamma=\kappa(\lambda) \dot{x}^\alpha \quad \text { (arbitrary parameter), }
$$
where $\kappa \equiv \mathrm{d} \ln L / \mathrm{d} \lambda$.



The geodesic equation can also be written as $u^\alpha{ }_{; \beta} u^\beta=\kappa u^\alpha$, in which $u^\alpha=\dot{x}^\alpha$ is tangent to the geodesic.
