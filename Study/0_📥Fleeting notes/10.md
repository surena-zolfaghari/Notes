Fermi normal coordinates are a set of coordinates often used in general relativity to describe a small region of spacetime around an observer moving along a geodesic (a freely falling observer). These coordinates are particularly useful for studying local physics in the vicinity of the observer.

In the case of the Schwarzschild metric, which describes the spacetime around a spherically symmetric mass (like a non-rotating black hole), Fermi normal coordinates can be constructed around an observer moving on a geodesic.


To construct Fermi normal coordinates around an observer, one would choose the observer's worldline as the temporal axis (tt) and the spatial axes (xixi) to be orthogonal to the observer's worldline.

Around the observer, the metric can be expanded in a Taylor series, and by choosing suitable coordinates, one can make the metric locally Minkowskian up to higher-order corrections. The resulting coordinates are the Fermi normal coordinates.
