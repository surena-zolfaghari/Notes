## Compton scattering
Created:2023-09-01 23-54

In 1916 he was ready to admit the photon is a particle because he added the photon has momentum

'photon' quanta (for energy also for momentum)

$$E^2-p^2c^2=m^2c^4 \;\; E=\dfrac {mc^2}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\,\,p=\dfrac {mv}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$$

There is similarity to relativistic in classical mechanics
$$E=\dfrac {1}{2}mv^2 \;\; p=m\vec{v} \Rightarrow E=\dfrac{p^2}{2m}$$
For photon you should use relativistic and the mass of photon is zero.
$$E_\gamma=p_\gamma c \Rightarrow p_\gamma=\dfrac {E_\gamma}{c}=\dfrac {h \nu_\gamma}{c}=\dfrac {h}{\lambda_\gamma}$$
So the idea that the photon is really a particle is starting to gather evidence, but people were not convinced about it until Compton did his work.

## What is Compton scattering?

It's shining x-rays to atom but this time very energetic x-rays

> X-rays. $100 \; \text{ev}$   to $100 \; \text{Kev}$

What are the energies, of binding energies of electron in atom? $10 \; \text{ev} \; 13\text{ev}$ for $H_2$. So x-rays can release election easily.

> Compton Scattering $\equiv$  photon scattering on electrons that are "virtually" free.

This work showed a violation of classical Thompson scattering

-  So the reason Compton scattering did the job and physicists. finally admitted the photon was a particle is that he made it look-like particle collision of a photon with an electron it could calculate and measure and treat the photon like a particle hit electron.

Thompson scattering



If it's low frequency wave, low energy electron. Magnetic Field does very little because thus electron does not move very fast $\Rightarrow$ The velocity is being small $\Rightarrow$ The Lorentz force is very Small.

But the electric field shakes the electron. And as election is being shaken, it's accelerating and therefore it radiates itself.
