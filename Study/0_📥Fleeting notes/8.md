In a manifold of dimension $n$, the Weyl curvature tensor is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta}= & R_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta}-\frac{2}{n-2}\left(g_{\alpha[\gamma} R_{\delta] \beta}-g_{\beta[\gamma} R_{\delta] \alpha}\right) \\
& +\frac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)} R g_{\alpha[\gamma} g_{\delta] \beta} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Show that it possesses the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor. Also, prove that any contracted form of the Weyl tensor vanishes identically. This shows that the Riemann tensor can be decomposed into a tracefree part given by the Weyl tensor, and a trace part given by the Ricci tensor. The Einstein field equations imply that the trace part of the Riemann tensor is algebraically related to the distribution of matter in spacetime; the tracefree part, on the other hand, is algebraically independent of the matter. Thus, it can be said that the Weyl tensor represents the true gravitational degrees of freedom of the Riemann tensor.
