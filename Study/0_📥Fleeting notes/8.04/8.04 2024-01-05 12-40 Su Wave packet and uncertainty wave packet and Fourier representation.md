# Wave packet and uncertainty wave packet and Fourier representation

It's first look into this Heisenberg uncertainty relationships. To begin let's focus it as fixed time $t=0$. I will write a particular wave function at $t=0$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Psi(x, 0)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int \Phi(k) e^{i k x} d k \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

And there is aloft to learn about this, but the physics that is encoded here is that any wave at $t=0, \psi\left(x_{10}\right)$ can be written as a superposition of states with momentum $\hbar k$. You remember $e^{i k x}$ represent a particle or aware carries momentum $\hbar k$. So this Whole idea here of a general wavefulcrion being written way, carries physical meaning for us. It's a quantum mechanical meaning, the fact that this kind of ware has momentum.
Suppose you know $\Psi(x, 0)$ then $\Phi(k)$ is then calculable. That's the foundation of Fourier's theorem.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Phi(k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int \psi(x, 0) e^{-i k x} d x \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

What I wish to explain now is how by looking at these expressions, you an understand the uncertainties that you find on the wave function position and momentum uncertainties how they are related. So that is our real goal.
If $\Phi(k)$ has some uncertainty, how is the uncertainty in $\psi$ determine? (relation ship of uncertainties)

As before we will take a $\Phi(k)$ and it's centered around some value $k_{0}$. It has some uncertainty

The concept of uncertainty at here is not precise. At this moment you just want to get a picture and the intuition of what's gong on. And let's assume that $\Phi(K)$ is real.
