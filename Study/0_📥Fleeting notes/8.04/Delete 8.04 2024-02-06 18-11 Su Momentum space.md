# About $\Phi(k)$
$\Phi(k)$ has the same information as $\Psi(x)$
$\Phi(k)$ is the weight of the plane waves in the superposition.

Now deeper, what $\Phi(k)$ can mean? In order to do we need a technical tool. It's delta functions. Delta functions are pretty use-full to manipulating objects and Fourier transformation.
