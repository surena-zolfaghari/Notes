observables and Hermitian operator.


We've said that an operator $\hat{Q}$ is Hermitian if

$$
\int d x \Psi_{1}^{*} \hat{Q} \Psi_{2}=\int d x\left(\hat{Q} \Psi_{1}\right)^{*} \Psi_{2}
$$

So you've learned already, this requires some properties a bout the wave functions for any at infinity, some integration by parts, we want to, Sometimes use a briefer notation

$$
\left(\psi_{1}, \psi_{2}\right) \equiv \int \psi_{1}^{*}(x) \psi_{2}(x) d x
$$

This concludes

$$
\begin{align*}
& *\left(a \psi_{1}, \psi_{2}\right)=a^{*}\left(\psi_{1}, \psi_{2}\right) \\
& *\left(\psi_{1}, a \psi_{2}\right)=a\left(\psi_{1}, \psi_{2}\right) \tag{$C$}
\end{align*}
$$

with this definition, a Hermitian operator can be written

$$
\left(\psi_{1}, Q \psi_{2}\right)=\left(Q \psi_{1}, \psi_{2}\right)
$$

We reviewed about Hermitian operator. Expectation value of $\hat{Q}$ in $\psi(x)$

$$
\langle\hat{Q}\rangle_{\psi}=\int \psi^{*} \hat{Q} \psi d x=(\psi, \hat{Q} \psi)
$$
# Claim 1
$\langle\hat{Q}\rangle_{\psi}$ is real
$\hat{Q}$ is Hermitian. But wait! why is this important? You have $\Psi^{*}, \psi$, well it'd better be real, if we're going to think, and that's the goal of discussion, that Hermitian operators are the things you can measure in quantum mechanics

$$
\begin{gathered}
\left(\langle Q\rangle_{\psi}\right)^{*}=\int d x\left(\psi^{*} \hat{Q} \psi\right)^{*}=\int d x \psi(\hat{Q} \psi)^{*}=\int d x(\hat{Q} \psi)^{*} \psi \\
\underset{\substack{\text { Hermitian } \\
\text { operator }}}{=} \int d x \psi^{*} Q \psi=\langle Q\rangle_{\psi}
\end{gathered}
$$
