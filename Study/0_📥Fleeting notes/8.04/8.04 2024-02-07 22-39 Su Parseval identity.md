# Parseval identity
Created:2024-02-07 22-39

What we want to understand now is really about momentum space. So we can ask the following question. What happens to the normalization condition that we have for the wave function, when we think in momentum variables?
$\int \Psi^{*} \Psi d x=1$ what about $\int d k \Phi^{*} \Phi=$
$$\int d x \underbrace{\Psi(x)^{*}}_{k} \underbrace{\Psi(x)}_{k^{\prime}}=\int d x \underbrace{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int d k \;\Phi^{*}(k) e^{-i k x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi} \int d k^{\prime} \Phi\left(k^{\prime}\right) e^{i k^{\prime} x}}_{\psi^{*}}$$
$k$ and $k$ ' integral's have no chance because they are abstract integrals. Maybe $d x$ integral does have a chance

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\int d k \Phi^{*}(k) \int d k^{\prime} \Phi\left(k^{\prime}\right) \underbrace{\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int d x e^{i\left(k^{\prime}-k\right) x}}_{\delta\left(k^{\prime}-k\right)} \\
& =\int d k \Phi^{*}(k) \int d k^{\prime} \Phi\left(k^{\prime}\right) \delta\left(k^{\prime}-k\right) \\
& =\int d k \Phi^{*}(k) \Phi(k)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Parseval theorem (plancherel theorem)

$$
\int d x|\Psi(x)|^{2}=\int d k|\Phi(k)|^{2}
$$

$\Phi(k)$ not only represents the weight with which you superimpose plane wave, but now it also satisfies a normalization condition. $\Phi(k)$ could be thought maybe as a probability distribution, in this new space, in momentum space.

I want to make momentum space a little bit more clear. And this involves a little bit of moving around with constants, but it's important.
