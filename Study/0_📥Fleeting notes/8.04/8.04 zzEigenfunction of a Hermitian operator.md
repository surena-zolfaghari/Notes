So here comes the point that this quite fabulous about Hermitian operators. Here is the thing that it really should impress you. It's the fact, that any all Hermitian operators have as many eigenfunction and eigenvalues as you can possibly need. Whatever that means, But they're rich. It's a lot of those states.
What it really means is that the set of eigenfunction for any Hermitian operator, whatever Hermitian operator, It's not just for some especially nice ones, for all of them you get eigenfunctions. And these eigenfunction, because it has vectors, they are enough to span the space of states.
That is any state can be written as a superposition of those eigenvectors. If you're thinking finite dimensional vector spaces, if you're looking at the Hermitian matrix, the eigenvectors will provide you a basis for the vector space. You can span anything in terms of eigenvectors. It's such an important theorem, it's called the specteral theorem in mathematics.

## Claim 3
Consider the collection of eigenfunction s and eigenvalues of the Hermitian operator Q.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q \psi_{1}=q_{1} \psi_{1} \\
& Q \psi_{2}=q_{2} \psi_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

And I actually don't specify if it's 'finite set or an infinite set. The infinite set, of course, is a tiny bit more complicated, but the results is the
