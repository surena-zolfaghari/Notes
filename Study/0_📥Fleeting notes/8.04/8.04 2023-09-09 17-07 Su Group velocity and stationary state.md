We assume that we have $\omega(k)$. If you give me $k$ I can tell you what it is $\omega$. Different waves have different relations.

Group velocity is the velocity of wave packet constructed by superposition of waves

$$\Psi(x,t)=\int dk \; \underbracket{\phi(k)}_{\text{Amplitude}}\underbracket{e^{i \overbracket{(kx-\omega t)}^{\phi(k)}}}_{\text{wave}}$$
