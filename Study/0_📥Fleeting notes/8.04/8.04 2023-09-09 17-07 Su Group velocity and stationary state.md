# Group velocity and stationary state

We assume that we have $\omega(k)$. If you give me $k$, I can tell you what it is $\omega$. Different waves have different relations.

Group velocity is the velocity of wave packet constructed by superposition of waves

$$\Psi(x,t)=\int dk \; \underbracket{\Phi(k)}_{\text{Amplitude}}\underbracket{e^{i \overbracket{(kx-\omega t)}^{\phi(k)}}}_{\text{wave}}$$

How it moves? We can pay two methods. Quick methods and analytical. First of all quick method, it's called principle of stationary phase.

## principle of stationary phase

Now since only for $k=k_0$, the integral has a chance to be non-zero.
The integral vanishes been outside of $(K-\delta, K+\delta)$ and in interval the wave is better be like is shown in below figure. the ware is not oscillating like crazy. Because It's going Cancel it out.

So It's better step oscillating there in order to get that contribution. Or another way only when the phase stops, you get a large contribution. So you need that phase becomes stationary w.r.t at $k_0$.
$$\dfrac{d\phi}{dk}|_{k_0}=x-\dfrac{d\omega(k)}{dk}|_{k_0}t=0$$
$$\Rightarrow x=\underbrace{\dfrac{d\omega(k)}{dk}|_{k_0}}_{\text{it's group velocity}}t$$
It's like
$$x=vt$$
