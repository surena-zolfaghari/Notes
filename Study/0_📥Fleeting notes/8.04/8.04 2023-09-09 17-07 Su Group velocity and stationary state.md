We assume that we have $\omega(k)$. If you give me $k$, I can tell you what it is $\omega$. Different waves have different relations.

Group velocity is the velocity of wave packet constructed by superposition of waves

$$\Psi(x,t)=\int dk \; \underbracket{\Phi(k)}_{\text{Amplitude}}\underbracket{e^{i \overbracket{(kx-\omega t)}^{\phi(k)}}}_{\text{wave}}$$

How it moves? We can pay two methods. Quick methods and analytical. First of all quick method, it's called principle of stationary phase.

Now since only for $k=k_0$, the integral has a chance to be non-zero.
The integral vanishes been outside of $(K-\delta, K+\delta)$ and in interval the wave is better be like  the Ware is not oscillating like crazy. Because It's going Cancel it out.

So It's better step oscillating there in order to get that centribut or amother way only when the phase stops, you get a large cont
So you need that phase becomes stationary wit at k
