So we have 

$$\Psi(\vec{x},t)=e^{i\vec{k}.\vec{x}-\omega t}$$
and 
$$\vec{p}=\hbar \vec{k} \;\;E=\hbar\omega$$
We could talk non-relativistic particles $E=\dfrac{p^2}{2m}$.
$\Psi$ is wave function for a free particle. And now I am going try to use this insight to figure out what is the equation that governs general wave functions. We have been led to this wave function by postulates of the de Broglie and experiments of Davisson and Germer and others that proves that pericles like
