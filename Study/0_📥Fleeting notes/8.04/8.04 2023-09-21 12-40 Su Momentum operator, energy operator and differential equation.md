So we have 

$$\Psi(\vec{x},t)=e^{i\vec{k}.\vec{x}-\omega t}$$
and 
$$\vec{p}=\hbar \vec{k} \;\;E=\hbar\omega$$
We could talk non-relativistic particles $E=\dfrac{p^2}{2m}$.
$\Psi$ is wave function for a free particle. And now I am going try to use this insight to figure out what is the equation that governs general wave functions. We have been led to this wave function by postulates of the de Broglie and experiments of Davisson and Germer and others that proves that pericles like 



electrons  have wave properties. You need to obtain this from some equation. And after having an equation you may get mere solution, It's useful for better Understanding. Now I try to figure out what is the equation? Probably a differential equation.

Now suppose you want to know momentum, probably you would say okay I pick $k$ from $e^{i(kx-\omega t)}$ and then $\hbar k$ gets p. Another way

$$\underbrace{\dfrac{h}{i}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}}_{\text{operator}} \Psi(x,t)=\hbar k \Psi=\underbrace{p}_{\text{number}}\Psi(x,t)$$

This operator: It could not be that acting on the wave function just gives a momentum. Because the exponential doesn't disappear after the differential operator acts.
