This is in a sense one of our first steps that we're going to take towards the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Already the wave function tells you about probabilities, but that's not quire enough to have the full interpretation.
So for example, if you have a random variable $Q$ that can take values in the set $Q_{1}, \ldots Q_{n}$ with probabilities $P_{1}, \ldots P_{n}$. In statistics, you would say that random variable has expectation value.
$$
\langle Q\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_{i} P_{i}
$$

The expectation value is the expected value or average value that you would obtain if you did the experiment of tossing the random variable many time.
So in quantum system we follow this analogy very closely. In quantum system $\Psi^{*}(x, t)\Psi(x, t) d x$ is the probability that the particle is in $(x, x+d x)$. The position of this particle is like a random variable. You never know where you're going to find it. But it has different probabilities to find it.

So we could now define in complete analogy to here. Expectation value of $\hat{x}$

$$
\langle\hat{x}\rangle \equiv \int x \Psi^{*}(x,t) \Psi(x, t) d x
$$
