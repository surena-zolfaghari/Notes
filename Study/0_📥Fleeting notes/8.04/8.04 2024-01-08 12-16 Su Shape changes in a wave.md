# Shape changes in a wave

Next is this phenomenon that when you have a wave packet and it moves it can change shape.

$$
\Psi(x, t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int{\Phi}(k) e^{i k x} e^{-i \omega(k) t}
$$

And what did we do with this to analyze how it propagates? we expanded $\omega(k)$

$$
\omega(k)=\omega\left(k_{0}\right)+\left.\left(k-k_{0}\right) \frac{d \omega}{d k}\right|_{k_{0}}+\left.\frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \frac{d^{2} \omega}{d k^{2}}\right|_{k_{0}}+\cdots
$$

And what did we do before? We did the integral with second term and ignore thenexto. $\frac{d m}{d k}$ is the speed of profile. group velocity). Now we want to go back and at least get an idea of how the third term could change the result. And it would charge the result by deforming the shape of the packet.

So it's of interest to know, for example, how long you have to wait before your packet gets totally deformed.
