# Shape changes in a wave

Next is this phenomenon that when you have a wave packet and it moves it can change shape.

$$
\Psi(x, t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int{\Phi}(k) e^{i k x} e^{-i \omega(k) t}
$$

And what did we do with this to analyze how it propagates? we expanded $\omega(k)$

$$
\omega(k)=\omega\left(k_{0}\right)+\left.\left(k-k_{0}\right) \frac{d \omega}{d k}\right|_{k_{0}}+\left.\frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \frac{d^{2} \omega}{d k^{2}}\right|_{k_{0}}+\cdots
$$

And what did we do before? We did the integral with second term and ignore thenexto. $\frac{d m}{d k}$ is the speed of profile. group velocity). Now we want to go back and at least get an idea of how the third term could change the result. And it would charge the result by deforming the shape of the packet.

So it's of interest to know, for example, how long you have to wait before your packet gets totally deformed.


$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{d \omega}{d k}=\frac{d E}{d p}=\frac{p}{m}=\frac{\hbar k}{m} \\
& \frac{d^{2} w}{d k^{2}}=\frac{\hbar}{m} \quad \frac{d^{3} w}{d k^{3}}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

And therefore I didn't have to worry about these terms. So what is that we get? Third term can be written:
$$
\frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \frac{d^{2} w}{d k^{2}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \frac{\hbar}{m}
$$

So back to integral, but I work with new term, I did integral for first and second terms.

$$
e^{-i \omega(k) t}=e^{\cdots-i \frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \hbar / m}
$$
But now we will just say that we expect, therefore that the shape does nit change as long as we can ignore this phase (third term), And this phase would start changing shape of the object.

## Statement:

We have no shape change or no appreciable shape change as long as $\underbrace{\left(K-K_{0}\right)^{2}}_{\Delta K} \frac{\hbar}{m}|t| \ll 1$
$$
\begin{equation*}
(\Delta k)^{2} \frac{\hbar}{m}|t| \ll 1 \rightarrow \frac{(\Delta P)^{2}|t|}{\hbar m} \ll 1 \tag{A}
\end{equation*}
$$
