# Shape changes in a wave
Created:2024-01-08 12:16

Next is this phenomenon that when you have a wave packet and it moves it can change shape.

$$
\Psi(x, t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int{\Phi}(k) e^{i k x} e^{-i \omega(k) t}
$$

And what did we do with this to analyze how it propagates? we expanded $\omega(k)$

$$
\omega(k)=\omega\left(k_{0}\right)+\left.\left(k-k_{0}\right) \frac{d \omega}{d k}\right|_{k_{0}}+\left.\frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \frac{d^{2} \omega}{d k^{2}}\right|_{k_{0}}+\cdots
$$

And what did we do before? We did the integral with second term and ignore the next. $\frac{d \omega}{d k}$ is the speed of profile (group velocity). Now we want to go back and at least get an idea of how the third term could change the result. And it would charge the result by deforming the shape of the packet.

So it's of interest to know, for example, how long you have to wait before your packet gets totally deformed.


$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{d \omega}{d k}=\frac{d E}{d p}=\frac{p}{m}=\frac{\hbar k}{m} \\
& \frac{d^{2} w}{d k^{2}}=\frac{\hbar}{m} \\
&\frac{d^{3} w}{d k^{3}}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

And therefore I didn't have to worry about these terms. So what is that we get? Third term can be written:
$$
\frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \frac{d^{2} w}{d k^{2}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \frac{\hbar}{m}
$$

So back to integral, but I work with new term, I did integral for first and second terms.

$$
e^{-i \omega(k) t}=e^{\cdots-i \frac{1}{2}\left(k-k_{0}\right)^{2} \hbar / m}
$$
But now we will just say that we expect, therefore that the shape does not change as long as we can ignore this phase (third term), And this phase would start changing shape of the object.

## Statement:

We have no shape change or no appreciable shape change as long as ${\underbrace{\left(K-K_{0}\right)}_{\Delta K}}^{2} \frac{\hbar}{m}|t| \ll 1$
$$
\begin{equation*}
(\Delta k)^{2} \frac{\hbar}{m}|t| \ll 1 \rightarrow \frac{(\Delta P)^{2}|t|}{\hbar m} \ll 1 \tag{A}
\end{equation*}
$$
If you know an uncertainty in $\Delta p$ of your packet, you know up to what time you can wait and there is no big deformation of this wave packet

Another thing you can do is involve the uncertainty in $x$, because $\Delta x \Delta p \simeq \hbar$.

$$
\frac{\Delta P}{m}|t|<<\frac{\hbar}{\Delta P}=\Delta x\Rightarrow |t| \ll \frac{m}{\hbar}(\Delta x)^{2}
$$

I think this is understandable. Why does the packet change shape? The reason it changes shape is because the group velocity is not the same for all the frequencies. The packer mostly moves with $K_{\text {of }}$ and we evaluated the group velocity in $k$. But if it would have a
definite velocity, would have definite momentum. But that's not possible These things have uncertainty in momentum and they have uncertainty in $k$.

So different parts of wave can move with different velocities, different group velocities. The group velocity you evaluated at $k_{0}$, But some par of the packet is propagating with group velocity that are near $K_{0}$ but not exactly there.

So you have a dispersion in velocity, which is an uncertainty in the velocity or an uncertainty in the momentum, And if you multiply the uncertainty in the velocity times this time that you can wait, then the change in shape is not much if this product $\frac{\Delta p}{m}|t|$ is still smaller than the uncertainty that controls the shape of the packet. So the packet has a $\Delta x$.

As long as the point $\alpha$ and the point $\beta$, the difference of velocities times the time, it just still compared to $\Delta x$ is small, then the thing doesn't change much.

from $A \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta P}{m}|t|<\frac{\hbar}{\Delta P} \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta P}{m}|t|<\Delta x$
