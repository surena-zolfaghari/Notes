Suppose you know the wave function $\Psi(x,0)$.Your goal is finding $\Psi(x,t).$

- step 1: calculate $\Phi(k)$
$$\Phi(k)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx\; \Psi(x,0)e^{-ikx}$$
- step 2: with this rewrite $\Psi(x,0)$
$$\Psi(x,0)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx\; \Phi(k)e^{ikx}$$
- step 3: 
$$\Psi(x,t)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dx\; \Phi(k)e^{ikx -i\omega(k)t} \tag{1}$$

recall
$$\boxed{\hbar\omega(k)=\dfrac {\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}}$$

and $(1)$ is the solution of $$i\hbar \dfrac {\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \dfrac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} \tag{*}$$ you can check it. The reason is interesting. If you check it, what that's important is $e^{ikx -i\omega(k)t}.$ And it's plane wave and it's solution.
