# Derivative Transformation
Created:2024-04-21 10-31

Transformation is straight forward because as I said the derivatives are vectors, and you can transform basis and components vector as we did for basis and component vectors earlier.

Now we use a new notation to showing basis.

## Why are derivatives operators vectors?

We introduced basis vectors as a derivatives operators. It's clear in flat space, but maybe you can appreciate this notation in curved space. So first of all we have to pay curved space.

## Curved space

To calculate velocity or determine position vector we need origin.
