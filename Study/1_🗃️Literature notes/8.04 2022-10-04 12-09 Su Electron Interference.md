I asserted in [[8.04 2022-06-21 06-06 Su Wave Function]] that particles have a wave nature. How might we check this in a laboratory? The classic signature of wave phenomena is interference ( constructive or destructive it depends on the phase). The wave nature of light was confirmed by Young in 1801. So if this experiment shows the same results, it will be accepted. Notice because the wavelength of an electron is very short, the gap between two slits should be close.

Now decrease the intensity of the electron beam until just one electron is present in the apparatus at any particular time. Every electron will produce a spot on the screen. Quantum mechanics is unable to predict exact local of spot. It can tell us probability of given electron landing at a particular place. But if we are patient, and wait for hundred thousand electrons- one at time- these accumulating spots reveal the classic two-slit interference pattern.

 Of course, if we close one of the slits, this result will change. The first reason is that boundary conditions of [[8.04 2022-06-20 06-05 Su Schrodinger Equation]] have been changed, and the second is the collapse of wave function upon measurement.
