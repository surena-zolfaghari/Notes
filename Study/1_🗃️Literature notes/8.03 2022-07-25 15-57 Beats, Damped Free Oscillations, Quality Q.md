## Beat
Suppose we have two simple harmonic motions with the same amplitude but different frequency.$$x_{1}= A\cos\omega_{1}t\hspace{2cm} x_{2} = A\cos\omega_{2}t$$
Also shown in the below figure, at some point, we don't hear a voice(If we consider $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ as sound propagation). It means waves cancel each other.
