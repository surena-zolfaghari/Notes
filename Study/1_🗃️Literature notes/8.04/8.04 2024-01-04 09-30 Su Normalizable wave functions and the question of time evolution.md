$$i \hbar \dfrac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x, t)\right) \Psi(x, t)\tag{*}$$
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Psi^{*}(x,t)\Psi(x,t)dx=1 \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\text{Hold for $t=t_0$}\tag{1}$$

Suppose the wave function has well-defined limits as $x \to \pm \infty$. If those limits are different from zero, the integral around infinity would produce an infinite result, which is inconsistent with the claim that the total integral is one. Therefore the limits should be zero in order to warranty $*$ can  hold it requires:
$$\lim_{x \to\pm\infty}\Psi(x,t)=0 \tag{2}$$
Maybe you say "I have the wave function is so crazy that it can be integrated, but suddenly it has a little spike and it just doesn't have a normal limit." We will assume that this situations are not happened. You can not Prove it's a necessary condition, but if it holds, it simplifies many many things and essentially, if the wave function is good enough to have limit, then the limit must be zero.

The other thing that we will want
$$\lim_{x \to\pm\infty} \dfrac {\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x}< \infty \tag{3}$$
The limit may exist and it may be a number, But is not infinite. And in every example that I know, in fact when $(2)$ goes to zero, $(3)$ goes to zero.

You shouldn't be too surprised that you need to $(3)$ about this wave function, because we have two derivative in $(*)$. So when we manipulate the right hand of equality in $(*)$ inside the integrals, you will see single derivatives will show up and we will have to control them.

We've said before that physics of a wave function is not altered by multiplying the wave function by a number. If your wave function has a finite integral $\int dx \;|\Psi|^2 = N$ and $N<\infty$, and if you are going to work with probabilities, you should use the following wave function
$$\Psi'=\dfrac {\Psi}{\sqrt{N}}$$
