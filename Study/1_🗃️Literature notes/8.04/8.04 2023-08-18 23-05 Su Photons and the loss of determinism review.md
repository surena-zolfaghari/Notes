4.1 Determinism:

Einstein <mark style="background: #55C5B2;">reluctantly</mark> came up with the idea that light was made of quanta. quanta of light called photon.

Every body knew that light was a wave (Maxwell's equations) but photoelectric effect, Planck's work, all were leading to the idea that photons are also particles

<p align="center"> Photons (light)       wave or Particle</p>
<br>
<mark style="background: #55C5B2;">Particle in the sense of Newton</mark>: is an object with zero size, that carries energy and has a precise position and velocity at any time.

Q<mark style="background: #55C5B2;">uantum mechanical idea of particle</mark> which is some indivisible amount of energy and momentum propagates.

So light was made of photons ( packets of energy). And it's a quantum mechanical particle. 

Einstein realized for a photon
$$E = h\nu$$
$$\nu \lambda = c$$

You typically know wave length $\Rightarrow$ know frequency $\Rightarrow$ know energy of photon.

The photons have very very little energy. But your eyes are very very good detectors of photons.

Consider plorizer, in fact if you send light in X direction, the light come out is identical to the light that came in. The frequency doesn't change. The wave length doesn't change. It has the same energy. Now imagine that we send at some angle $\alpha$.

$$E= E_0 \cos \alpha \hat{X} +E_0 \sin \alpha \hat{Y} \tag{1}$$

After polarization
$$E= E_0 \cos \alpha \hat{X}$$
You know the a energy on electromagnetic field is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field square. Then Fraction of energy through $\cos^2\alpha$. Now think what it means for photons? Is very extraordinarily strange.

Consider a beam that made of billion photons. Photons are identical. You know what has to happen because classical mechanical behavior is right. This fraction ($\cos^2\alpha$) photons must go through and ($1 - \cos^2\alpha$)  don't go through.

You see, it cannot be there comes a photon and half of it goes through. Because there's no such thing as half of it. If there would be half of it, it would be half of energy and  therefore different color. And we know after polarization the color doesn't change.
