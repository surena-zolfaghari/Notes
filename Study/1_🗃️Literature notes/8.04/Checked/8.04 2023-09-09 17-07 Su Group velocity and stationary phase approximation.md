We assume that we have $\omega(k)$. If you give me $k$, I can tell you what it is $\omega$. Different waves have different relations.

<mark style="background: #55C5B2;">Group velocity is the velocity of wave packet constructed by superposition of waves.</mark> We assume that the function $\Phi(k)$ is peaked around some wave number $k = k_0$,

$$\Psi(x,t)=\int dk \; \underbracket{\Phi(k)}_{\text{Amplitude}}\underbracket{e^{i \overbracket{(kx-\omega t)}^{\phi(k)}}}_{\text{wave}}$$

How the packet moves in time? We can pay two methods. Quick methods and analytical. First of all quick method, it's called principle of stationary phase.

## principle of stationary phase

Now since only for $k=k_0$, the integral has a chance to be non-zero.
The integral vanishes been outside of $(K-\delta, K+\delta)$ and in interval the wave is better be like is shown in above figure. The wave is not oscillating like crazy. Because It's going cancel it out.

So It's better stop oscillating there in order to get that contribution. Or another way only when the phase stops, you get a large contribution. So you need that phase becomes stationary w.r.t at $k_0$.
$$\phi(k)=kx-\omega(k)t$$
$$\Rightarrow{k}\dfrac{d\phi}{dk}|_{k_0}=x-\dfrac{d\omega(k)}{dk}|_{k_0}t=0$$
$$\Rightarrow x=\underbrace{\dfrac{d\omega(k)}{dk}|_{k_0}}_{\text{it's group velocity}}t$$
It's like
$$x=vt$$
