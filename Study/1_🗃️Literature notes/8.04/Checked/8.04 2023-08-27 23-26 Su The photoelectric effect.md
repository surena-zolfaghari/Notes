# The photoelectric effect

I spoke about surprising measurement with photon. Now I want to back by thinking about photons as physicist did one hundred years ago and came up with quantum mechanics.

The photoelectric effect (An experiment by Herz 1887)

After releasing photo electron, you get photoelectric current.

## Four properties of photoelectric

1. Polished metal plate irradiated may emit electrons.


 > Photo electrons $\Rightarrow$ Photo electric current

2. There is a threshold frequency $\nu_0$? Such that only $\nu>\nu_0$, there is a current.

>$\nu_0$ depends on the metal and configuration of atom at the surface.



3. Magnitude of the current proportional to the light intensity

4. Energy of the photo electrons independent of the intensity of the light



$(3,4) \; \Rightarrow$ <mark style="background: #2BE611A6;">The number of photo electrons would depend  on the intensity of light, but not the energy of photo electrons</mark>



How does increase energy $E$? 
$E_{e^{-}}$ increases <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">linearly</mark> with the frequency of the light. photoelectric is not easy to understand if you think of light as a wave.

Einstein came up with an answer. that he almost said what was going on. He said the light comes in bundles of energy. And in a beam you have bundles of energy quanta, did not quite say light is a particle.

Einstein (1905): light is composed of quanta (photon,actually photon is a word by chemist Lewis in 1920) with energy 
$$E = h\nu$$

$$W \equiv \text{work function} \equiv \text{Energy needs to release an electron}$$

Work function depends depends on: metals Structure, how well you have polished the surface.

$$E_{e^{-}} \simeq \dfrac {1}{2}mv^2 = E_\gamma - W = h\nu - W \quad\text {Einstein's prediction}$$


$E_\gamma \equiv \text {Energy of photon}$

It wasn't obvious increases linearly (I marked above). Measurement of the energy of emitted particles was not all that easy either.

The experimental confirmation took 10 years to come. It was verified by Millikan in 1915.

# Millikan (1915)

- verified Einstein's conjucture

- And and $h$ is measured to better than $1\%$

So you would say, OK, so this is a wonderful, now every body believes in photons. But that's quite far from truth. They didn't believe photon because Maxwell had been to successful.

And Einstein Knew when yo accept in particles like photons you had subject to these case of loss of determinism and the waves that we have sometimes as particle and he didn't like that.

><mark style="background: #FF2C61;">Remember:</mark>$$\hbar = \dfrac {h}{2\pi}, \; \hbar c =197.33 \; Mev.fm\simeq 200 \; Mev.fm$$
$$1 \; fm = 10^{-15}$$

<mark style="background: #55C5B2;">Example:</mark> shine UV light $\lambda = 200 \; nm$ on a metal $W=4.05\;ev$. What is the energy $E_{e^-}$? what's their speed?

$$E_\gamma = h\nu = \dfrac {hc}{\lambda} =  \dfrac {2\pi\hbar c}{\lambda} = 4.28 \; ev$$

$$E_{e^-} = E_\gamma-W=4.28 - 4.05 = 0.23 \; ev$$


That's a kinetic energy and that should be non-relativistic, because the rest mass of an election is about half a million $ev$ $(511000 \;ev)$

$$0.023 = \dfrac {1}{2}mv^2 = \dfrac {1}{2} m_e c^2 v^2/c^2 = \dfrac {1}{2}511000 \; v^2/c^2 \Rightarrow v= 284 \; km/s$$
