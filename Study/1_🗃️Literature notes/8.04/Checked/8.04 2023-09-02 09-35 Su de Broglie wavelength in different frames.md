Free particle with momentum $p$ associated to a plane wave with wavelength $\lambda=\dfrac {h}{p}.$ So this wave is what eventually becomes a famous wave function. 

When you have waves, like electromagnetic waves, you have polarization, you have directional properties, the electric field points in some directions. Is there a same property for the wave function? Yes.

But it has to do with spin. When the particles have spin, there are directional properties of the wave. and typically you use several wave functions that corresponds to directional components of this wave.

Photons are spin 1 particle, electrons or spin $\dfrac {1}{2}$ particles so there will be directional properties to it.

But to begin with, let's consider cases where this directional properties don't matter so much. And for the case of electrons, If the electrons have small velocities or they are inside small magnetic fields, where some of these properties of the spin is important. We can ignore that and work with a wave function that will be a complex number.

$$\Psi(x,t)\in \mathbb{C}$$

Is that measurable? what's meaning?

These waves are no ordinary waves. They are very strange because $\lambda \propto p$. Why? Consider two frames.

$$p=\dfrac {h}{\lambda}=\dfrac {h}{2\pi}\dfrac {2\pi}{\lambda}=\hbar k \;\;,\;\; \omega=2\pi \nu$$
$$x'=x-vt \;\;,\;\; t=t' $$
$$\dfrac {dx'}{dt'}=\dfrac {dx}{dt}-v \Rightarrow \tilde{v'}=\tilde{v}-v \Rightarrow p'=p-mv$$

$$\lambda'=\dfrac {h}{p'}=\dfrac {h}{p-mv}\neq \lambda$$
This is very strange. For sounds waves or water waves, Galilean observers will find frequency changes but no changes in wavelength. You see this in next note.
