# de Broglie's proposal
Created:2023-09-02 07-00

In 1924, the photon as a particle is clear, and the photon is also wave. de Brogle has a brilliant insight. He said if this is supposed the photon is wave and particle. If they are dual-ed with respect to each other, the both descriptions are in different regime

- wave attributes because it interferes and describe by wave
- Particle attributes because definite amount of energy it comes in packet, They cannot broken into other things.

So de Broglie did a fundamental step almost as important as Schrodinger. <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">He claimed that all matter particles behave as wave as well, not just photon</mark>

But that is quite interesting because in quantum mechanics you have the photon, and it's particle and now associated to a wave. Now you may say: OK, it's electromagnetic wave. But No, in quantum mechanics, it's the probability amplitude.

Those are the numbers, we tracked in the Mach-Zender interferometer. We didn't track the wave or a single photon. The wave was a wave of probability amplitude. Something they didn't know at all about yet at that time.

<mark style="background: #FF2C61;">But what is left unsaid here is yes, you have a waves but a wave of what?</mark> I've already told about probability amplitude. It's very strange the fundamental equation for a wave that represents a particle is not an electric field or a sound wave. It's for all of them is a probability wave. It's very very surprising

This is particle wave duality. <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">de Broglie Said: It's universal for all particles. </mark>and the name is <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">"matter wave!</mark>" wave of what? The answer came latter. They are wave of <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">probability amplitude</mark>.



Just like we had for photons, deBroglie's ides was that we would associate to a particle $p_\lambda=\dfrac {h}{\lambda_\gamma}$ a wave that depends on the momentum. 

So remember the Compton wavelength was a universal for any particle the Compton wavelength is just one number. But just for photons the wavelength depends on the momentum. So in general. It should be dependent on the momentum

So we say that for a particle of momentum $p$, we associate a plane wave.

It's a pretty daring statement. It was his PhD  thesis, and there was no experimental evidence for it. It was a natural conjecture.

A few years later people saw that you could interfere or diffract electrons. They would behave colliding into lattices like waves. These are rather famous experiments of Davisson and Germer.  So Particles do as an interference effect a two slit interference effect.

We have such pattern because of the wave nature of photons, or in quantum mechanics, you would say because they are probability amplitudes, that they are complex numbers that have to be interfered between the possibilities of  the two paths (like Mach-Zender). Because every photon goes through both paths at the same time. 

These experiments of interference, or two slits interference were done for electrons. Eventually They've been dose for bigger and bigger particles.  We did such experiment with molecules.

<mark style="background: #2BE611A6;">So particles, big particles interfere, not just photons. So particles have some waves, some matter wave discovered by de Broglie.</mark>
