# Photon is a particle but quantum mechanical paritcle

## 4.1 Determinism:
Einstein <mark style="background: #55C5B2;">reluctantly</mark> came up with the idea that light was made of quanta. quanta of light called photon. Every body knew that light was a wave (Maxwell's equations) but photoelectric effect, Planck's work, all were leading to the idea that photons are also particles
<br>
<p align="center"> Photons (light)       wave or Particle</p>
<br>

<mark style="background: #55C5B2;">Particle in the sense of Newton</mark>: is an object with zero size, that carries energy and has a precise position and velocity at any time.

<mark style="background: #55C5B2;">Quantum mechanical idea of particle</mark> which is some indivisible amount of energy and momentum propagates..

So light was made of photons ( packets of energy). And a photon is a particle. It's a quantum mechanical particle. Not in the sense that maybe it has position and velocity determined or it's at point particle, but more like a packet <mark style="background: #2BE611A6;">that's indivisible</mark>. You can not decompose it in further packets.

Einstein realized for a photon
$$E = h\nu$$
$$\nu \lambda = c$$

You typically know wave length $\Rightarrow$ know frequency $\Rightarrow$ know energy of photon. And then you know the energy of each of the photons.
<br>
<mark style="background: #FF2C61;">The photons have very very little energy.</mark> But your eyes are very very good detectors of photons, If you are in a totally dark room, your eyes probably can take as little as five photons, if They hit your retina.

$$E= E_0 \cos \alpha \hat{X} +E_0 \sin \alpha \hat{Y} \tag{1}$$

After polarization
$$E= E_0 \cos \alpha \hat{X}$$
You know the a energy on electromagnetic field is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field square. Then Fraction of energy through $\cos^2\alpha.$ Now think what it means for photons? Is very extraordinarily strange.

Consider a beam that made of billion photons. Photons are identical. You know what has to happen because classical mechanical behavior is right. This fraction ($\cos^2\alpha$) photons must go through and ($1 - \cos^2\alpha$)  don't go through.

You see, it cannot be there comes a photon and half of it goes through. Because there's no such thing as half of it. If there would be half of it, it would be half of energy and  therefore different color. And we know after polarization the color doesn't change.

Now Consider $\dfrac {1}{3}$ go through and $\dfrac {2}{3}$ absorb. But photons are identical. How can that happen?

In classical physics, If you send identical photons, whatever happens to a photon, will happen to all. If one absorbs, other should be absorbs. It's disaster. You've lost predictability.

So people speculate: Yes photons are identical, but polarizer has a substructure. If it hits in this inter-atomic part. it goes through and in that inter-atomic doesn't go through.

After experiments this idea ruled out. Einstein and others said: "There is hidden variables that we don't know. Photons have hidden variables. If You know that you can Predict. And the great progress of John Bell inequalities is that he demonstrated that would not fix the problem.


Quantum mechanics cannot be made deterministic with hidden variables. We've lost determinism. We can only predict probabilities.



We write in classical physics like $(1)$. How do we write the wave of function of a photon?


<p align="center"> Dirac notation </p>

$|photon,x\rangle \equiv$ the photon polarized in $x$ direction
$|photon,y\rangle \equiv$ the photon polarized in $y$ direction


Superposition yields:
$$|photon,\alpha\rangle = \cos\alpha \; |photon,x\rangle + \sin\alpha \; |photon,y\rangle \tag{2}$$
What happens photon wave function as it goes through the polarizer? If photon goes through after polarization the wave function become $$|photon,x\rangle \tag{*}$$
<mark style="background: #FF2C61;">In $(*)$ why is not $\cos\alpha$?</mark> $\cos\alpha$ is not relevant. If goes through whole photon goes through. 

$(2)$ is about one photon. and $(1)$ is for a beam. <mark style="background: #2BE611A6;">what was wrong with the hidden variable explanation?</mark>

There is philosophic problem. It's If you don't know what are hidden variables, how tell you this parameter is relevant. 

Anyway John Bell said: You could design experiment in which the hidden variables would imply that some measurements would satisfy an inequality. If the existed hidden variables and the world was after all classical, the results of experiments satisfy Bell inequality.

After years and the technology was good enough that people tested it. They figure out it didn't hold.

<p align="center">Hidden variables lead to Bell inequality </p>

That are experimentally shown not to hold. 

<mark style="background: #55C5B2;">And that's why I mentioned at the first Einstein reluctantly came up with the idea that light was made of quanta. Because this assumption leads to this results.</mark>
