Quantum mechanics is linear. Because the hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics is linear and given by:
$$
\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})
$$

Assuming the potential function $V(r)$ is a function of position (and not more complex), is also linear when <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">acting on the wave function.</mark>
$$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi=\hat{H}\Psi$$
There are certain cases where **non-linear** Hamiltonians might appear in **Non-linear Quantum Mechanics (Bohmian mechanics or QFT).**

$\Psi$ is not always the function of position, when I locked an electron and I want to know the physics of that electron, position is not relevant. Its spin is relevant.

No physical interpretation for the wave function was obvious for the people that invented quantum mechanics. it took a few month for Max Born said it has to do with probabilities.
