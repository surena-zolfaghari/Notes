# 1 QM as a framework
Created:2023-08-13 23-00

In 1925 $\rightsquigarrow$ Schrodinger & Heisenberg $\rightsquigarrow$ wrote down QM equations. However QM is started in early 19 century


Quantum mechanics is really a framework to do physics. and correct the description of fundamental theory.  Quantum physics is the principles of QM applied to different physical phenomena. 

- Quantum electrodynamics  which is quantum mechanics applied to electromagnetism. 
- Quantum chromodynamics which is quantum mechanics applied to strong interaction.
- Quantum optics which is quantum mechanics applied to photons.
- You have quantum gravity when you try to apply quantum mechanics to gravitation. And that's what gives rise to string theory which is presumably a theory of gravity and in fact the quantum theory of all interactions, If it's correct. Because not only describes gravity, it describes all other forces.

So Quantum mechanics is a framework.
## 1.1 What are the properties?

- ﻿﻿﻿Linearity of QM
- Necessity of Complex number
- ﻿﻿﻿Loss of determinism
- Superposition Unusual
- Entanglement

# Linearity
When You have a theory, Yow have some dynamical variables. These are the variables you want to find their values because they are connected with observation. t's very useful in practice. For example all cell phones, radio stations and millions phone calls go simultaneously without affecting each other. A transatlantic cable can conduct millions phone calls at the same time and as much data and video and internet. It's all superposition. All information go simultaneously through without interfering with each other.  


## What is that mean in mathematics? 

In order to check linearity, it's just enough to check two below conditions: suppose $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ 
$$L(\alpha U) = \alpha LU \quad\mathrm{and}\quad L(U_{1}+U_{2}) = LU_{1}+LU_{2} \tag{*}$$
Linear equation:

$$LU = 0 \tag{1}$$

where $L \equiv$ Linear operator 
and $U \equiv$ Unknown. 

Now you can check linearity. It's just enough that Check two properties at $(*)$. 

Example:
$$\dfrac {du}{dt}+\dfrac {1}{\tau}u=0$$
$$Lu=0$$
The operator can be calculated:
$$Lu=\dfrac {du}{dt}+\dfrac {1}{\tau}u$$
And finally

$$L= \dfrac {d}{dt}+\dfrac {1}{\tau}$$
Now you can check linearity. It's just enough that check two properties at $(*)$.
