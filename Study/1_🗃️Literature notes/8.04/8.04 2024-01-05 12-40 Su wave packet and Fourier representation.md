It's first look into this Heisenberg uncertainty relationships. To begin let's focus it as fixed time $t=0$. I will write a particular wave function at $t=0$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Psi(x, 0)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int \Phi(k) e^{i k x} d k \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

And there is a lot to learn about this, but the physics that is encoded here is that any wave at $t=0, \Psi(x,0)$ can be written as a superposition of states with momentum $\hbar k$. You remember $e^{i k x}$ represent a particle or a wave carries momentum $\hbar k$. So this whole idea here of a general wave function being written in this way, carries physical meaning for us. It's a quantum mechanical meaning, the fact that this kind of wave has momentum.

Suppose you know $\Psi(x, 0)$ then $\Phi(k)$ is then calculable. That's the foundation of Fourier's theorem.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Phi(k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int \Psi(x, 0) e^{-i k x} d x \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

What I wish to explain now is how by looking at these expressions, you an understand the uncertainties that you find on the wave function position and momentum uncertainties how they are related. So that is our real goal.
If $\Phi(k)$ has some uncertainty, how is the uncertainty in $\Psi$ determine? (relation ship of uncertainties)

As before we will take a $\Phi(k)$ and it's centered around some value $k_{0}$. It has some uncertainty in the value of momentum. The concept of uncertainty at here is not precise. At this moment you just want to get a picture and the intuition of what's going on. **And let's assume that $\Phi(k)$ is real.**


With this conditions for $\Phi(k)$, what happens with $\Psi(x)$ ? If you want to know where $\Psi(x, 0)$ peaks, you must look where the phase is stationary? Here $e^{i k x}$ is phase and $\Phi(k)$ does not contribute to the phase. The only contribution to the integral is basically around $k_{0}$. So in order to get something, you must have a stationary phase. And the phase must be stationary as a function of $k$, because you're integrating over $k$. And the phase is $k x$. And the derivative with respect to $k$ of the phase is just $x$ and that must be vanish, therefore, so you expect this to be peaked around $x$ equals 0.

$$
|\Psi(x, 0)| \text { peaks at } x=0
$$

And let me mention, I've already become fairly imprecise here. I've sort of glossed over a small complication here. The complication is that this, when I talk about peaking of $\Psi$, and you probably have seen it already, You have to worry whether $\Psi$ is real or complex. Actually is not real.

You've done, perhaps, in the homework already these integrals and you see that $Y$ is not real. So when I say it peaks at $X=0$, how am I supposed to plot Y? Am I plotting real part the imaginary part, the absolute value? $S_{0}$. it's reasonable to plot the absolute value peaks at $x=0$. And there is a $\Delta x$ width uncertainty in $\Psi(x)$.

یک نکته‌ی دیگری هم هست در انتگرال دوم نمیشود این استدلال را کرد و ماکزیمم ان را بدست اورد. چون من در انتگرال اول فرض کردم که $\Phi$  حقیقی است. ولی میدانیم که $\Psi$ در حالت کلی مختلط است چون مولفه مختلط دارد روی فاز تاثیر میگذارد و روش stationary اینجا کار نمیکند.
