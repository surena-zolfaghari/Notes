> <mark style="background: #55C5B2;">Physical assumptions</mark>: If you have a state and you superimpose it to itself, you have not do anything.

$$|A\rangle \equiv 2|A\rangle \equiv -|A\rangle \equiv i|A\rangle$$

It's a physical assumption, can we test it?



We can make some sense of this assumption at this level? We can do it on states of light. we spoke about 2 photons ploraized. Along the $X$ axis an $Y$ axis. These are two quantum mechanical states.

Now suppose to form general photon state:
![[Drawing 2023-08-19 09.27.55.excalidraw]]
$$|A\rangle=\alpha \;|photon,X\rangle+\beta \;|photon,Y\rangle \tag{1}$$where 
$$\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$$

How many parameters does this state have? 4 real, 2 complex. It's disaster cause we showed earlier 2 real numbers is needed and  the free degree of system can not be difference. Now this assumption will help us.

You think about polarization state can be expressed with 2 real numbers, and this assumption helps. By multiplying $(1)$ to $\dfrac {1}{\alpha}$
$$\dfrac {1}{\alpha}|A\rangle= |A\rangle= \;|photen,X\rangle + \dfrac {\beta}{\alpha}\;|photen,Y\rangle \tag{2}$$

$\dfrac {\beta}{\alpha}$ = one complex number.

> Thanks to this assumption!

It's crucial because as earlier that we mentioned, two numbers is needed to say the state of photon, but here we need two complex numbers that means we need to four numbers. This assumption enable us likely I did in $(2)$, and now I need two parameter like as earlier is mentioned. The parameter of system is not changed. In quantum mechanics, as we have explained, linearity holds. The interpretation of a superposition, however, is very surprising and crucial.

If you have a polarization, a most generalization state of a wave is an elliptical polarization. Electrical field in a circular polarization, the electric field at any point traces a circle. If you have elliptical polarization, the electric field trace an ellipse.

The size doesn't matter. Its the shape of ellipse that matters that's characterized with eccentricity or by the ratio $a$ over $b$ of the semi major axis $(\dfrac {a}{b}, \theta)$



# Spin

Spin is a property of elementary particles. They're rotating.
They have intrinsic angular momentum, as if they would be made of a tiny little ball that is spinning.
I said as if, because nobody has ever constructed a model of an elementary particle, where you can really make it spin and calculate how it works.

You never find zero or a little. You would find up or down with full magnitude.

Spin is very quantum mechanical. And if they're quantum mechanical, then should we have:
$$|\Psi\rangle = |\uparrow,Z \rangle + |\downarrow,Z \rangle$$

Einstein objected and said imagine:

1000 copies of an electron, measure their spin. You will find 
$$50\% \quad |\uparrow,Z\rangle$$
$$50\% \quad |\downarrow,Z\rangle$$

Einstein said in this superposition isn't quiet right. Maybe at first you have 500 up and 500 down. In fact he would say even more: Einstein used "<mark style="background: #FF0000;">realism</mark>". If I find spin up, it means before measuring was up. Now we know it's not true because after measuring the spin is up or down. In Quantum mechanics the state is mixed and it was mixed before measure. After measure it took up or down.

But here's the catch. Now if you take the particles and measure along $x$ axis, you will find of them along up. while in this Einstein ensemble of $50\%$ up and $50\%$ down along $x$ axis.


So there is an experiment that can tell difference but you have to look in another direction. And that experiment of course can be done. and calculation can be done. And you can decide whether these quantum states exist.
