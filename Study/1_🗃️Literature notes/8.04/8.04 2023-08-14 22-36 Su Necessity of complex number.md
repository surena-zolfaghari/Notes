You always use complex numbers in an auxiliary way like in electromagnetism. It was not directly relevant because the electricity field, velocity, etc.  <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">They are real and the equations are real</mark>. On the other hand in quantum mechanics, the equation has an $i$.<mark style="background: #55C5B2;"> You need complex numbers. They're not auxiliary.</mark> on the other hand you can never measure a complex number.

# What is the interpretation of $\Psi$?
Max Born had the idea

$$\Psi \in \mathbb{C} \rightsquigarrow |\Psi|^2 \equiv \text{probabilities}$$

Many people hated this. Schrödinger hated it. Einstein was wrong in that way. and many good physicist are wrong, They are not wrong for silly reasons. They are wrong for good reasons.

We can learn from their thinking. Like EPR (Einstein-Pedlaski-Rosen) had an attempt to show quantum mechanics are wrong. the EPR paper itself was wrong but it brought up ideas that turned out.
