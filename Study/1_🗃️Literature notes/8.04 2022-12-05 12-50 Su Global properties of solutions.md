# Global properties of solutions:

If you solve infinite square well you get this traits that they are global.

- **They are alternately even and odd**, with respect to the center of the well: $\psi_1$ is even, $\psi_1$ is odd, ψ3 is even, and so on.
- **As you go up in energy, each successive state has one more node** (zero-crossing): $\psi_1$ has none (the end points don’t count), $\psi_2$ has one, $\psi_3$ has two, and so on.
- **They are mutually orthogonal**, in the sense that
$$\int \psi_m(x)^* \psi_n(x) d x=0, \quad(m \neq n)$$
- **They are complete**, in the sense that any other function, f (x), can be expressed as a linear combination of them.
Now let me generalize them:
>The first is true, whenever the potential itself is a symmetric function.

>The second is universal regardless of the shape of the potential.

>The third and forth is quite general and we will prove the third in chapter 3.
