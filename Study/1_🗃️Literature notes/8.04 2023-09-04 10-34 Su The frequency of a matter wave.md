#  The frequency of a matter wave
Created:2023-09-04 10-34
We spoke about $\lambda$. What is the frequency of a matter waves?
de Broglie did the answer:
$$p=\hbar k$$
$$E=\hbar \omega$$
$$\therefore \quad\omega=\dfrac {E}{\hbar}$$
And complete the story.

$$V_{\text {phase}}=\dfrac {\omega}{K}=\dfrac {E}{P}\overset{\text {non relatvisitic}}{=} \dfrac {\dfrac {1}{2}mV^2}{mV}=\dfrac {1}{2}V$$
It's the velocity in which the nodes and maxima of this plane wie

So IS Ihave aparticle with E, p, E= L muz, Pamv. and now seems the wave is moving half the speed of particle!

! That looks pretry bad!

What's going on?

This is the usuall stery with waves. If the wave iself deesn't a plane wave Carries no real information. If's not a signal. So man times when you try to represent the partiele or alittle bit of information traveling representing it with a plane wang is acully wrong.

You have to represent it with a wave packet

Vphase

    ﻿﻿This wave is very strange
    ﻿﻿phase veloat isnot very meaning fut
    physically

meaningfull. velocity is group velocity



And This equality is the reason people did believe de Broglie.

Actually it's true relativisticly as well. pat Pand E relatuskely and this angwer comes out exactly the same.
