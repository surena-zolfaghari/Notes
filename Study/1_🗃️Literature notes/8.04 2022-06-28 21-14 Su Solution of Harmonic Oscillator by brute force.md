## Schrodinger equation eigenstate

As a mathematician, If you know $V(x)$ and $E$, you can solve the $(1)$. But as you saw in [[8.03 2022-11-04 08-50 Su SHO]]
$$-\frac {\hbar^2}{2m}\frac {d^2}{dx^2}\Psi(x) + V(x)\Psi(x)=E\Psi(x) \tag{1}$$
Bound state
$$\Psi(x)_{|x| \to \infty}\to 0$$
### First claim
If $V(x)$ is a smooth potential (you can take derivative) then $\Psi(x_{0})=0$ and $\Psi'(x_{0})=0$ imply that $\Psi(x)=0$ identically. The reason is a second derivative differential equation is determined with value of function and derivative at same point. Now with this assumption, this trivial initial condition, $\Psi(x)=0$.

### Second claim
Bound states in one dimensional **no degeneracy** is possible. You will never find tow bound states two bound states of a potential that are different that have the same energy.

## Node
