Spin is a property of elementary particles. They're rotating.
They have intrinsic angular momentum, as if they would be made of a tiny little ball that is spinning.
I said as if, because nobody has ever constructed a model of an elementary particle, where you an really make it spin and calculate how it works.

You never find zero or a little. You would find up or down with full magnitude.

Spin is very quantum mechanical. And if they're quantum mechanical, then should we have:
$$|\Psi\rangle = |\uparrow,Z \rangle + |\downarrow,Z \rangle$$

Einstein objected and said imagine:

1000 copies of an electron, measure their spin. You will find 
$$50\% \quad |\uparrow,Z\rangle$$
$$50\% \quad |\downarrow,Z\rangle$$

Einstein said in this superposition isn't quiet right. Maybe at first you have 500 up and 500 down.
In fact he would say even more: Einstein used "realism".
If I find spin up, it means before measuring was up. Now we know it's not true because after measuring the spin is up and down simultaneously.

But here's the catch. Now if you take the particles and measure along $x$ axis, you will find of them along up. while in this Einstein ensemble of $50\%$ up and $50\%$ down along $x$ axis.


So there is an experiment that can tell difference but you have to look in another direction. And that experiment of course can be done. and calculation can be done. And you can decide whether these quantum states exist.
