de Broglie formula:
$$p=\dfrac {h}{\lambda} = \dfrac {2\pi\hbar}{\lambda}$$
I’ll explain this in due course. Many authors take the de Broglie formula as an axiom, from which they then deduce the association of momentum with the operator $−i/\hbar (\partial/\partial x)$. Although this is a conceptually cleaner approach, it involves diverting mathematical complications that I would rather save for later.

The uncertainty principle:
$$\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$
