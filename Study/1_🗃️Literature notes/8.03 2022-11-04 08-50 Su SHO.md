## SHO
We know equation of simple harmonic oscillator.$$x=x_{0}\cos (\omega t +\phi)$$
$\omega$ is angular frequency and$$T = \dfrac {2\pi}{\omega}, f =\dfrac {1}{t}$$Now consider uniform circular motion. project this trajectory to x axis. it results in 
$$x= x_{0}\cos(\theta), \theta= \omega t +\phi$$ finally we have$$x= x_{0}\cos(\omega t +\phi)$$
$\omega$ is angular velocity.

In general, there is different between angular velocity and frequency. But, in this case both are the same.

Now let's go to spring. The equation is governed$$m\ddot{X}=k X$$ Now we define $\omega = \sqrt{\dfrac {k}{m}}$
$\omega$ is independent of my initial conditions. Nature has one answer for the frequency and that's only determined by $k, m$. 

Now let describe another way, assume put a spring vertically. Due to gravity the object will come to a halt equilibrium a little bit. Now I displace it from this equilibrium position. And I let it to oscillate. I get exactly the  same frequency. It means, you can define $X=0$ at the point that spring displaced by gravity.

This discussion is true when the mass of spring is negligible. Now what do we do when mass can not be ignored?


## Physical Pendulum
The period of pendulum is $$T = 2 \pi \sqrt {\dfrac {l}{g}}$$
T is independent of amplitude, but it is not entirely true. It's true for small angles.

We need force for preventing accelerate down.$$\vec\tau = I\vec\alpha$$ $\vec\alpha$ is angular acceleration. What's the torque related to point of p
$$lmg\sin\theta = I_{p}\ddot{\theta}$$

Now with approximation ($\sin\theta\approx \theta$) we have: $$\ddot\theta +\dfrac {lmg}{I}=0$$
solution is $$\theta=\theta_{0}\cos(\omega t+\phi) \tag{1}$$$\omega$ is angular frequency and equal with $$\omega = \sqrt{\dfrac {lmg}{I_{p}}} \tag{2}$$ and the period of oscillation is$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\dfrac {I_{p}}{lmg}}$$In equation $1$ $\omega$ is angular frequency. Don't confuse with $\omega = \ddot{\theta}$ that is called angular velocity also. angular velocity is a strong function of time ($\omega = \dfrac {d\theta}{dt}$), but angular frequency in $2$ is not depend on time. When the object comes to a halt $\omega = 0$ because $\dot\theta = 0$. But in uniform circular motion, both are same.
