# State diagrams and the nature of physical laws
Created:2022-05-18 08:43

There is two questions in classical mechanics. the first question is:
**What is the specific law for a particular system?** particular system can be about planet movement or movement charged particle in magnet field. it means there is specific nature. 

And the second question is about general framework or general rule. **What are the rules for the allowable laws? Are there rules for allowable laws?** 

the first question will provide an illustration and another question is govern the allowable laws.

## what is not rule allowable? by me !
A rule can be predictable and unable to retro dict. this means you know configuration at now but you can't realize history or past step. This word is mean the rule is not reversible. This is kind of law, that is not allowed in classical physics. why? Because classical physics does not allow probability.

Laws of Classical statistical mechanics begins with laws of mechanics. There are limits on predictability. Assume we have a system that enable us to predict perfectly. If we have no information about initial conditions exactly, we unable to predict. Predictability depend on our knowledge. This ambiguity is not related to equation even due to our knowledge. We should notice a system like coin, it has two states. And we can identify initial conditions perfectly. But, in nature you face with continuous properties i.e the position and velocity vectors. And you can never know perfect initial conditions. Now you can understand In real world, and the idea predictability is a little complicated.
