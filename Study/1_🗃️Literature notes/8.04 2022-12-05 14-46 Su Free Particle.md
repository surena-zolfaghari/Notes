If you deal with the free particle, you will see the separable solutions do not represent physically realizable states. Because they won't be normalize. A free particle cannot exist in a stationary state; or, to put it another way, there is no such thing as a free particle with a definite energy. 
Therefore we must consider all of them as a wave packet. Maybe this work will be yield. I mean maybe the combination of them be normalizable. Then our work is finding the appropriate coefficients for normalizing the linear combination.
