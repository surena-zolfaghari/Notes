## Max Born vs Schrodinger & Albert

Schrodinger thought that $\Psi$ represents particles that disintegrate You have a wave function, and the wave function spread all over space. So the particle has distinguished completely

> More $\Psi$ $\rightarrow \;$More particle is there



> $$ \boxed{\underbrace {dp(x,t_0)}_{Probability\; of\; find \;at \;x\; at\; time\; t_0,\; within\; cube.}=|\Psi(\vec{x},t_0)|^2\;d^3x}$$

 If you have a single particle It better be $$\int_{over\; space}d^3x\;|\Psi(\vec{x},t_0)|^2 =1 \tag{*}$$
But maybe, there is some difficulties. You wrote Schrodinger equation, and it tells you how $\Psi$ evolves in time. Suppose you have  $\Psi$ all over space at $t_0$. Schrodinger equation determines $\Psi$ for any time. So knowing in specific time, it gives wave function for other time. So we could run into problem. If  the integral $*$ be one, you can not force this integral be one in other time. Because the wave function now is determined by the Schrodinger equation. In the next section we pay to it.
