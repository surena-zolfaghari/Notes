# Angular momentum
Created:2022-12-27 18-16

Angular momentum is defined:
$$L = r \times p \tag{1}$$
It's clear the angular momentum can be changed if we calculate angular momentum respect to different points. After calculate the derivative of equation $(1)$, we have  
$$\dfrac {dl}{dt}|_{q}= r_{q} \times F =\tau_{ext}$$
Consider a circular motion. The toque at the center of circle (that we call $c$), the angular momentum is constant. There is some important about point $c$. 
Now I want to expand the angular momentum from one point object that moves in space to a body like sphere or disk that which is rotating about its center of mass. It's straightforward. You just take an element and calculate it. Now let me do it for a disk with center of $c$:
$$L_{disk}= I \omega$$
Now comes a question is this angular momentum different for an arbitrary point in space like $A$? Probably you will say yes. But wait!
> If you have a rotation about the center of mass. Then even if you calculate the angular momentum relative to this point or any other point. You will find the same answer.

When there is a rotation about the center of mass, we call that the **spin angular momentum.** Spin angular momentum is a intrinsic property of system regardless of which point you choose.
