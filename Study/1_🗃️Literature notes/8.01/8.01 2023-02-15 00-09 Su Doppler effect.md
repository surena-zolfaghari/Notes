Audience is fix and source of sound is moving. This statement in electromagnetic is meaningless.

$$f' = f(1+\dfrac {v}{c} \cos\theta) \tag{1}$$

Now when we deal with sound, there is something mechanically oscillating. something vibrating. With electromagnetic radiation charges are vibrating with a certain frequency (or certain period because $T=1/f$). How far does electromagnetic radiation in the time of one period? 
$$\lambda = cT=\dfrac {c}{f}$$
We call it wave length of electromagnetic radiation. In the optical astronomy we can not measure the period or the frequency of optical light, all we can measure is the wavelength.

$$\lambda' = \lambda(1-\dfrac {v}{c} \cos\theta) \tag{2}$$
you can derive $(2)$ from $(1)$ and then you have to use Taylor expansion for  $v << c$  and then you would have the equation $(2)$ simply. 15:12
