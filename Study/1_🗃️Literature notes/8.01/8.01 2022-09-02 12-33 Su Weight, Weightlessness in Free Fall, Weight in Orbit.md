## What is weight?
 The force from the bathroom scale on you, we define as weight. In absence of friction and the massless string $T_{1}=T_{2}$.

$m_1$ and $m_2$ are same mass.

## Weightlessness
**Sometimes, some people use zero gravity. It is wrong. The correct phrase is zero weight or weightlessness.** If you stand on a table and hold a box, the table and box exert force on you and vice versa. If you jump from table to ground, you feel weightless, and you won't feel a box in your hand. In physics, we have no non-negotiable. There is no free lunch. When you hit to ground, you will pay for it. In duration impulsive, you will feel it.
