Assume a circular motion with variable angular velocity
$$v = \omega R = \dot{\theta} R$$
$$a_{tan}= \dot{\omega} R = \ddot{\theta}R = \alpha R$$
$\alpha$ is angular acceleration. $a_{tan}$ is different from the centripetal acceleration. The centripetal acceleration causes curved motion (in this case circular motion). And there should be another acceleration for producing variable angular velocity and it's due to angular acceleration or tangential acceleration.


## Parallel axis theorem
we have the moment of inertia about center of mass, now we want to calculate about axis $l'$:
$$I_{l'} = I_{CoM} + mR^2$$
## perpendicular axis theorem
When the object be thin, then
$$I_z=I_x+I_y$$

# Rotational kinetic energy 
We can convert rotational kinetic energy to linear motion and versa. It's very practical. For instance, assume a car is on top of a hill and the road is very dangerous. In this situation, you should brake but this operation converts the energy to heat or noise. You can put a disk that gets the energy of wheels and the disk starts to rotate. This rotational kinetic energy can be converted into motion without losing energy. it's better to say a copious lesser amount of energy is lost.
