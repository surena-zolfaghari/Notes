4.1 Determinism:

Einstein reluctantly came up with the idea that light was made of quanta. quanta of light called Photons.

Every body knew that light was aware. Maxwell's equations had been so successful. a Nevertheless photoelectric effect, Planck's work. All were leading to the idea that photons are also particles.



Photons (light)       wave or Particle



When you think about particle. there is an kind of important between a particle in the sense of Newton which is an object with zero size, that carries energy and has a precise position and velocity at any time.

And Quantum mechanical idea of particle which is some indivisible amount of energy and momentum propagates.

So light was made of photons ( packets of energy). And a photon is a particle ( a quantum mechanical particle) Not in the sense that maybe it has position and velocity determined or it's at point particle, but more like a packet that's indivisible. You can not decompose it in further packets.

Einstein realized for a photon
$$E = h\nu$$
$$\nu \lambda = c$$

You typically know wave length $\Rightarrow$ know frequency
