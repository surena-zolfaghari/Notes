4.1 Determinism:

Einstein reluctantly came up with the idea that light was made of quanta. quanta of light called photon.

Every body knew that light was wave. Maxwell's equations had been so successful. a Nevertheless photoelectric effect, Planck's work. All were leading to the idea that photons are also particles.

     Photons (light)       wave or Particle

When you think about particle. there is an kind of important between a particle in the sense of Newton which is an object with zero size, that carries energy and has a precise position and velocity at any time.

And Quantum mechanical idea of particle which is some indivisible amount of energy and momentum propagates.

So light was made of photons ( packets of energy). And a photon is a particle ( a quantum mechanical particle) Not in the sense that maybe it has position and velocity determined or it's at point particle, but more like a packet that's indivisible. You can not decompose it in further packets.

Einstein realized for a photon
$$E = h\nu$$
$$\nu \lambda = c$$

You typically know wave length $\Rightarrow$ know frequency $\Rightarrow$ know energy of photon
<br>
The photons have very very little energy.

But your eyes are very very good detectors of photons, If you are in a totally dark room, your eye probably can take as little as five photons, if They hit your retina.

Now Consider plorizer

Into fact if you send light in X direction, the light come out is identical to the light that came in. The frequency doesn't change. The wave length doesn't change. It has the same energy.

Now imagine that we send at some angle $\alpha$.

$$E= E_0 \cos \alpha \hat{X} +E_0 \sin \alpha \hat{Y}$$

Alter polarization
$$E= E_0 \cos \alpha \hat{X}$$
You know the a energy on electromagnetic field is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field square. Then Fraction of energy through $\cos^2\alpha$.

Now think what it means for photons?
