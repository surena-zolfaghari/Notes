# Some properties of separation solutions

 > For normalizable solutions, the separation constant E must be real.

>The time-independent wave function $\psi(x)$ can always be taken to be real (unlike $\Psi(x, t)$, which is necessarily complex). This doesn’t mean that every solution to the time-independent Schrodinger equation is real; what it says is that if you’ve got one that is not, it can always be expressed as a linear combination of solutions (with the same energy) that are.

>If  $V(x)$ is an even function (that is, $V (−x) = V (x)$) then $\Psi(x)$ can always be taken to be either even or odd.

> $E > V_{min}$
