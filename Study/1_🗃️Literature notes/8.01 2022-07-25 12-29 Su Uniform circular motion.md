##  1.1 Angular velocity
It's not about how many meters per seconds but it's about how many radians per seconds.  $T$ is period, which means the time is needed a object to back to start point. $f$ is named frequency. $T$ related to $f$ with below formula:
$$ f = 1/T$$
$\omega$ is angular velocity. It is defined $$\omega = \dfrac {2 \pi}{T}$$I want to calculate velocity. Now you can consider a circle with a radius $r$ which go around once â€Œ
$$v = \dfrac {primeter}{time} = \dfrac {2\pi r }{T} = \omega r$$
$\omega$ is same along the string that connected to ball and it's turning. But it's different for planets.

## 1.2 Centripetal acceleration
It's clear that existence of acceleration. That is non-negotiable. the magnitude of centripetal acceleration is 
$$\lvert {a_c} \rvert =\dfrac {v^2}{r}=\omega^2r$$
$a_c$ is linear respect to r.  Don't think it's proportional $\dfrac {1}{r}$ because $v$ is a function of $r$. Now the accelerate must be caused by something. If you sit in turntable, you feel that seat is pushing you in your back.


## 1.3 Idea of centrifuge
Look at an object that we're going to rotate. Marble is very light and so tiny. put it in a glass tube. nor glass push marble nor marble pull glass tube. Marble needs a centripetal acceleration to rotating. But there is nothing provided that centripetal acceleration. Then marble continues its direction that it was going.

## 1.4 Connection between centripetal acceleration and rotation
I want to make a connection between centripetal acceleration one hand and a rotation in other hand. I'm going to make a connection between centripetal acceleration and perceived gravity.

So gravity perceived is in opposite direction respect to pull. Now assume

I can explain this by story of carpenter and plumb line. In the last example plumb line is in direction NE, but gravity perceived is in opposite direction.

### 1.4.1 Example for finding gravity perceived (artificial gravity)
Magnitude of centripetal acceleration of  this spaceship is $10 m/s^{2}$. Also radius of this spaceship is $100$ meter.

You can't go from $A$ to $B$ without stairs or elevator as same as earth that you are not able walk to ceiling.  You can't go opposite of gravity. Now if you be in $B$, it's true. This situation is like you stand above a building with height $100$ meter. It's suicide(without stairs and elevator).

Now let's do this for a liquid that its particle is very tiny and so light. They will not sink to the bottom. They are suspended. Surface of liquid is perpendicular to gravity force. Now rotate this tube. What will happen?

It's obvious perceived gravity is in west direction. How to diagnosis this? With using the point that gravity perceived is perpendicular to surface, we conclude surface should be vertical. Notice the gravity of ground is extremely small respect to perceived gravity (we can neglect it.). 

I want to mention a hint for start working with centrifuge. You must balance  it. It's very important. Otherwise you observe shaking and it can effect on final result. If you put something  at $A$, put same weight in $B$.

He introduced perceive gravity. perceive gravity is always opposite of pull or push.
