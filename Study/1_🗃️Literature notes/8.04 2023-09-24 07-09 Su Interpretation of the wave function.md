## Max. Born vs Schrodinger & Albert
Schrodinger thought that $\Psi$ represents particles that disintegrate. You have a wave function, and the wave function spread all over space. So the particle has distinguished completely.

> More $\psi \rightarrow$ More particle is there

Max Born solved S.E for a particle that hits a coulomb potential then they found the wave function falls off $\dfrac {1}{r^2}$. "But we did experiment, the particle choose a way and it goes one way and when you measure it, you get the full particle. particle never disintegrate", Max Born said.

Max Born said: $\Psi$ doesn't tell how much of the particle $m$ at $x$ at time $t$, But rather what's the probability to find it at $x$ at time $t.$

$$
d p(x, t)=|\psi(\vec{x}, t)|^{2} d^{3} x
$$

probability of find at $x$ at time t. whitin cube.

If you have a single particle it better be

54

$$
\int d_{\text {oversee }} d^{3} x\left|\psi\left(x, t_{0}\right)\right|^{2}=1
$$

But maybe there is some difficulties. You wrote S.E, and it tells you how $\psi$ evolves in time suppose you have $\psi$ 'all over space at $t_{0}$. S.E determines $\psi$ for anytime by integrating.

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=\hat{H} \psi
$$

So we could ron into aproblem. If the integral $(x)$ be 1, you can not farce this integral be one in other time. Because the wave function now is determined by the S.E.
