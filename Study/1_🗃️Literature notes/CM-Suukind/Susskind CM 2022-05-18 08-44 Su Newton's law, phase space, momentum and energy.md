>Accuracy and reversibility. 

Reversibility means you don't lose information. You can recoup the past as well as the feature. He 

phase diagram is important.


Newtonian's equations in that sense reversible, in that if you take a movie of a possible motion and run it backward it's another solution. I mean you can't able to distinct among solution. Both movie has same solution.

## third newton's law
remember additional action and reaction is not enough. you also consider this force should be along line of center mass.

For real force we have a potential like $V$:
$$f=-\frac {dV(x)} {dx}$$
