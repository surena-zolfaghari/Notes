Each mirror multiply $-1$, so ignore them. What do I get out?

$$\text {output} = \text{BS2}\;\text{BS1} \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix} \beta \\ -\alpha \end{pmatrix}$$

## First experiment



![[Drawing 2023-08-26 13.23.02.excalidraw]]

After BS1 and mirrors, They recombine. And actually there is a interesting interference. From the top, beam came some amplitude and after BS2, gave some reflected and some transmitted. From bottom beam, there was some transition and some reflected. 

The transmission of from the top and reflected of the bottom interferes give zero. And the transmission of the bottom and reflected from the top coherent and added up to 1.

In 1891, 1892, They had no ability to manipulate photon, But they could put these beam splitters.

## Second experiment

What happens? I can't use previous formula. I have to calculate
$$\text {BS1} \left(\begin{array}{l}
0 \\
1
\end{array}\right) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{rr}
-1 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}
0 \\
1
\end{array}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
1
\end{array}\right)$$

$$\text {BS2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{rr}
1 & 1 \\
1 & -1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}
\frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{1}{2}
\end{array}\right)$$
So by blocking a source, you are getting more somewhere. It's somewhat counter intuitive. You will see as soon as, it's not just somewhat counter intuitive, it's tremendously counter intuitive.

> In my view: In first experiment, we knew with certainty where is photon. But by blocking we lose certainty.


$$\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline \text { Outcome } & P \\
\hline \text { photon at block } & \frac{1}{2} \\
\hline \text { photon at D0 } & \frac{1}{4} \\
\hline \text { photon at D1 } & \frac{1}{4} \\
\hline
\end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline \text { Outcome } & P \\
\hline \text { photon at DO } & 1 \\
\hline \text { photon at D1 } & 0 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$
