How can such an object represent the state of a particle? Born's statistical interpretation. This interpretation enters a indeterminacy. We can't talk exactly.

Question: Where was a particle before I made the measurement?
There are many answers for explaining this. I mention them in below, but There are some answers that are not in three categories. 
- Realist: They believed that indeterminacy is not a fact of nature. Some hidden variables are unknown to us.
- Orthodox: Observations not only disturb what is to be measured but also produce it.
- Agnostic: Don't ask! Let it goes

There exist viable non-local hidden variable theories (notably David Bohm’s), and other formulations (such as the many worlds interpretation) that do not fit cleanly into any of my three categories.

But in 1969, Bell discovered an unequally. Bell's discovered ruled out agnostics then the choice correct should be between realist or orthodox. Finally suffice it to say the experiments have decisively confirmed the orthodox interpretation (see notice at above. it is just a little too strong):
“a particle simply does not have a precise position prior to measurement, any more than the ripples on a pond do; it is the measurement process that insists on one particular number, and thereby in a sense creates the specific result, limited only by the statistical weighting imposed by the wave function.” ([Griffiths and Schroeter, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/X4VKQ5N4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBT95Y2Z?page=19))
