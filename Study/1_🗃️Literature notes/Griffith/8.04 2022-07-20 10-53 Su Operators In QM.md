$$\hat x = x$$
$$\hat{p}=-ih\frac {\partial}{\partial x}$$
$$\hat{H}= \dfrac {\hat p^2}{2m} + V$$
Canonical commutation relation $$[x, \hat{p}]=i \hbar \quad or \quad [\hat{x}, \hat{p}]=i \hbar$$
In a deep sense, all of mysteries in quantum mechanics can be trace with this fact that position and momentum don't commute. Some authors take canonical commutation relation as an axiom and use it to derive $\hat{p}=-ih\frac {\partial}{\partial x}$.

$$\hat{a}_{\pm} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \hbar m \omega}}(\mp i \hat{p}+m \omega x)$$
$${\left[\hat{a}_{-}, \hat{a}_{+}\right]=1 }$$
We will examine Hermitian operators and will define their conjugate. In the language of linear algebra $\hat{a}_{\pm}$ is Hermitian adjoin of $\hat{a}_{\mp}$.
