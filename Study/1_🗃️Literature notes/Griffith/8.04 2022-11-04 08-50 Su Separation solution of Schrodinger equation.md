# Separation solution of Schrodinger equation
We assume potential is independent of time $(V= V(x))$in Schrodinger equation. Now let's solve this with separation of variables method. Suppose$$\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x) \phi(t)$$
Replace this to Schrodinger equation now we have:
$$i\hbar \frac {1}{\phi} \frac {d\phi}{dt}=-\frac {\hbar^2}{2m} \frac {1}{\psi}\frac {d^2 \psi}{dx^2} +V$$
then we conclude:
$$i\hbar \frac {1}{\phi} \frac {d\phi}{dt}=E =-\frac {\hbar^2}{2m} \frac {1}{\psi}\frac {d^2 \psi}{dx^2} +V$$ where $E$ should be constant. We can rewrite these equations like a set equations.
$$\frac {d\phi}{dt}=\frac {\phi}{i\hbar}E \tag{1}$$
$$-\frac {\hbar^2}{2m} \frac {d^2 \psi}{dx^2} +V\psi=E\psi \tag{2}$$
The solution of $(1)$ is 
$$\phi(t)=\,e^{\frac {-iEt}{\hbar}}$$
$\phi$ is also dubbed *wiggle factor.*
we call $(2)$ the **time-independent Schrodinger equation**. We can go no further until V(x) is specified. The rest of note, we focus on solving time-independent Schrodinger equation. **Why do I focus on the separation solutions?** What's so great about separable solutions? In the next step,  I'll mention importance of these solutions. In my view it's clear but you guys are idiots. Let's do it. :))))))
