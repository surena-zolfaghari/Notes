At the first we will pay for separation solutions and their traits. Also we focus on crucial role of these solution in [[8.04 2022-11-04 08-42 Su Importance of separation solutions of Schrodinger equation]]. And in continue discuss about fixing coefficients by Fourier trick ([[8.04 2022-12-04 15-17 Su Computation of other physical expectation variables]]).  For better understanding, we will examine five of important examples of Schrodinger equation. Notice some of features are general.
