# Schrodinger Equation
Like Newton's second law, in quantum mechanics we have Schrodinger equation. If we have wave function in initial condition, we will have wave function in future by Schrodinger equation. Newton's law determine $x(t)$ for all time. 


$$i\hbar\frac {\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \frac {-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac {\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V\Psi  \tag{1} $$

where $\hbar$ is equal
$$\hbar = \frac {h}{2\pi}=1.054573 \times 10^{-34} J s$$
