$$\mathbb{P}(x,t)=\int_{a}^b \,dx\;\Psi(x,t) $$
Notice this probability is related to finding particle between a and b at specific time t not all time.

For us wave function and all its derivatives go to zero at $x \to{\infty}$. **I have a problem with this. See [[8.04 2022-12-19 15-25 Su Questions In Quantum Mechanics]]**
