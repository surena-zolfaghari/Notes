> <mark style="background: #55C5B2;">Physical assumptions</mark>: If you have a state and you superimpose it to itself, you have not do anything.

$$|A\rangle \equiv 2|A\rangle \equiv -|A\rangle \equiv i|A\rangle$$

It's a physical assumption, can we test it?

حالا شاید بگی چه معنی داره؟

We can make some sense of this assumption at this level? We can do it on states of light. we spoke about 2 photons ploraized. Along the $X$ axis an $Y$ axis. These are two quantum mechanical states.

Now suppose to form general photon state:
$$\alpha \;|photon,X\rangle+\beta \;|photon,Y\rangle \tag{1}$$where 
$$\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$$

How many parameters does this state have? 4 real, 2 complex

You think about polarization state can be expressed with 2 real numbers, and this assumption helps. By multiplying $(1)$ to $\dfrac {1}{\alpha}$
$$\dfrac {1}{\alpha} (1) \; \Rightarrow \;|photen,X\rangle + \dfrac {\beta}{\alpha}\;|photen,Y\rangle $$

$\dfrac {\beta}{\alpha}$ = one complex number

> Thanks to this assumption!


If you have a polarization, a most generalization state of a wave is an elliptical polarization. Electrical field in a circular polarization, the electric field at any point traces a circle. If you have elliptical polarization, the electric field trace an ellipse.

The size doesn't matter. Its the shape of ellipse that matters
that's characterized with eccentricity or by the ratio
$a$ over $b$ of the semi major axis $(\dfrac {a}{b}, \theta)$.
