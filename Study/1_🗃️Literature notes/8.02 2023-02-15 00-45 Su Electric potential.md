# Potential Energy and Electric potential
Electrostatic potential energy U: The work that is needed I do to form a distribution charge is called electrostatic potential energy. In other word, the work that is needed that I should carry a charge from infinity to position P. 
$$W_{me} = \int_{\infty}^R \vec{dr}. \vec{F}_{me} = \int_{R}^\infty \vec{dr}. \vec{F}_{el} = U$$

Electric potential V:  The work per unit of charge that I should carry an unit charge from infinity to position P. 
$$V = U/q$$
$$V_A = \int_A ^\infty \vec{dr}. \vec{E}$$
