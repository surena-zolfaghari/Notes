# Galilean transformation of ordinary wave
Created:2023-09-3 17-36

$$\text{phase}\equiv \phi =  kx-\omega t$$

$\phi$ is Galilean invariant. What it means is that two people looking at this wave and they look at the point on this wave, both people will agree on the value of the phase.
So If you have a place where the wave has a maximum or a phase where the wave is $O$. This is an ordinary wave.
