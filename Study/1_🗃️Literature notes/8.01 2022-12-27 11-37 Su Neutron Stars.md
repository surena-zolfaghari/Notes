# Rotational kinetic energy
We discussed about rotational kinetic energy. Now we come back to old theory about energy of universe and the light of sun. **What is the source of the sun's energy and light?** Decades ago our ancients said: all of it is due to rotational energy, but now we know that nuclear fusion plays this role. you can calculate and get the order of energy.

But notice, sometimes the old theory is right! For example there is an object which we call the *Crab Pulsar*. It's an neutron star and it is located in the result of a supernova explosion that went off in the year  1054. 
Pulsar is radiating copious amounts of X-ray of gamma ray and jet coming out of ionized gas. That all energy that this object is producing comes from kinetic energy. For more explanation, If you measure the period of this star, you will see a decrease in its time period. And you can calculate the difference in the rotational kinetic energy between today and yesterday. Now If you compare this number with energy that radiates from Pulsar, these numbers would be equal exactly.
