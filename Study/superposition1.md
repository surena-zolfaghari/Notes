$|A\rangle =a:$ If you measure some property (momentum, position, energy) on $|A\rangle$ you always get $a$.

Suppose you have a quantum mechanical state and now you measure that same property. You measure it in your state
$$\alpha|A\rangle + \beta|B\rangle \tag{1}$$What will You get if you measure $(1)$? Never get intermediate. Sometimes you get "a" and sometimes get you "b" but with different probability. This is very different that we have classical mechanics. You have two waves with different amplitudes, and add them now measures the energy you get intermediate.

$$Prob(a) \propto |\alpha|^2 $$
$$Prob(b) \propto |\beta|^2 $$

In quantum mechanics results are not intermediate. If you get "a" state become $|A\rangle$. It's unusual superposition.
