It's unusual superposition. Suppose you have a quantum mechanical state and now you measure it
$$\alpha|A\rangle + \beta|B\rangle \tag{1}$$What will You get if you measure $(1)$? ==It's not intermediate==. Never get intermediate. Sometimes you get "a" and sometimes get you "b" but with different probability.

$$Prob(a) \propto |\alpha|^2 \quad Prob(b) \propto |\beta|^2  $$
In quantum mechanics results are not intermediate. If you get "a" state become $|A\rangle$. 

<mark style="background: #55C5B2;">Physical assumptions</mark>: 
$$|A\rangle \equiv 2|A\rangle \equiv -|A\rangle \equiv i|A\rangle$$
This assumption is crucial because save us see [[8.04 2023-08-23 10-17 Su More on superposition]]

$$\Psi\; \text{can not be measured}$$
