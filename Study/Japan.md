# What was the trigger for having an interest in Japan?


My interest in Japan was sparked during a late-night study session in my undergraduate years, when I came across a documentary about Japan's approach to science and technology. What struck me wasn’t just the country’s advanced research infrastructure, but the quiet precision and philosophical depth with which scientific inquiry was approached. It was the first time I saw science portrayed not just as a technical pursuit, but as something deeply cultural — embedded in discipline, harmony, and persistence.

Later, I discovered how Japan handled fields like condensed matter physics and materials science with both theoretical elegance and industrial relevance. This deeply resonated with me, as I’ve always wanted my work in physics to be both rigorous and useful. I started reading more about Japanese physicists, such as Yoichiro Nambu and Leo Esaki, and was fascinated by how they bridged conceptual breakthroughs with experimental innovation.

Japan didn’t just become a place I admired — it became a place where I felt science was understood in the way I wanted to understand it: as a craft, a philosophy, and a tool for societal progress. That subtle but powerful shift in perspective is what made me say, “This is where I want to grow as a physicist.”

## second version

My fascination with Japan began during my undergraduate years in mathematics in Iran, when I first encountered the work of Hideki Yukawa, whose meson theory revolutionized particle physics. As someone transitioning from abstract mathematics to a burning passion for physics, Yukawa’s blend of mathematical rigor and physical insight captivated me. Learning about Japan’s contributions to quantum mechanics—through scientists like Yukawa and later Makoto Kobayashi—sparked my admiration for a country that seemed to nurture such groundbreaking ideas. This academic curiosity grew stronger during my M.Sc. in physical oceanography at the University of Tehran, as I explored MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on quantum mechanics, special relativity, and general relativity, often encountering references to Japan’s cutting-edge facilities like RIKEN and the Kamioka Observatory. Japan began to symbolize the kind of physics I wanted to pursue: precise, innovative, and deeply theoretical.

Beyond the equations, Japan’s culture captured my heart in ways I hadn’t expected. One rainy afternoon, I picked up The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa from a local bookstore, drawn to its quiet cover. The story of a mathematician with a fading memory, connecting with his housekeeper and her son through the timeless language of numbers, moved me profoundly. As an Iranian, I saw echoes of my own culture’s reverence for storytelling and human bonds in the novel’s tender exploration of memory and connection. It painted Japan as a place where even the ordinary—a housekeeper’s care, a baseball game—could feel profound, and it left me eager to explore more of its literature and ethos.

This cultural pull deepened when I watched Spirited Away, a Studio Ghibli masterpiece that enchanted me with its vibrant world and heartfelt story. As a student navigating my own unconventional path from mathematics to oceanography and now to physics, I connected with Chihiro’s journey of courage and self-discovery in a strange, magical world. The film’s depiction of Japanese values—like respect for nature and community—resonated with the Persian traditions I grew up with, where hospitality and harmony are cherished. I found myself rewatching scenes, marveling at the meticulous animation and dreaming of visiting a country that could inspire such creativity. I even started learning basic Japanese, chuckling as I mispronounced “arigatou gozaimasu,” finding the language’s structure as satisfying as solving a physics problem.

A turning point came during an online physics discussion group, where I met a Japanese student researching quantum entanglement at Osaka University. Over a virtual chat, he described Japan’s collaborative research culture and the serene beauty of places like Kyoto, where ancient temples coexist with modern labs. His stories made Japan feel tangible—a place where I could chase my academic dreams while immersing myself in a culture that values discipline and imagination. For someone like me, whose journey to physics has been shaped by personal challenges and relentless curiosity, Japan represents a unique harmony of scientific excellence and cultural depth.

Pursuing a Master’s in physics in Japan feels like the natural next step. It’s a chance to contribute to a scientific community I’ve long admired, from Yukawa’s legacy to today’s quantum innovations, while embracing a culture that has touched me through Ogawa’s words and Miyazaki’s worlds. This scholarship is my opportunity to bridge my past—rooted in Iran’s storytelling and my academic detours—with a future in Japan, where I hope to grow as a physicist and a global citizen.

# Why do you choose Japan as a destination to study graduate-level education?

  Why not!


# What kinds of things do you think you can contribute to Japan and your home country through your experience of studying in Japan

It's a tough question. I want to refer a qoute from 


Look I want to apply for a scholarship in Japan in master physics. I should fill a motivation based on some questions. One of questions is about "-What was the trigger for having an interest in Japan?". so write the answer such that the answer be real and acceptable and humanize. The answer not be routine and some sheet, you know. If you need some information about my background ask.

Here's the question:
What was the trigger for having an interest in Japan?

Ok My nationality is Iranian. My B.Sc is mathematics. After graduation in undergraduate, I wanted to start physics. But due to some personality reasons, I couldn't. So I started physical oceanography in university of Tehran. After graduation in M.Sc, I feel it's not enough and I want to start a new master program in physics. 

I started to seeing quantum mechanics lectures in MIT course ware. and then other courses like general relativity and special relativity. If you need more information go ahead. 

From literature I have real The Housekeeper and the Professor impressed me. I love anime and I enjoyed when I was watching Spirited Away
