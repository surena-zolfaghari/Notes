I have a question please solve this and give me answer in latex format I want to run in latex and get pdf format

Prove the identity in four-dimensional:
$$\epsilon_{ksmn}\epsilon_{rtmn} = -2 * (\delta^{r}_{k} \delta^{t}_{s} - \delta^{r}_{s} \delta^{t}_{k})$$



In $\mathbb{R}$ let ($x^{\alpha}$) = (x , y) denote Cartesian and (
a- If the vector field X has components
(
) = (R , ) plane polar coordinates .
) then find
.
