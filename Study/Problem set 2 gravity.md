I have a question please solve this and give me answer in latex format I want to run in latex and get pdf format


loo k i want to run in latex it is not in latex format i want to copy all in one time not copy box to box

Prove the identity in four-dimensional:
$$\epsilon_{ksmn}\epsilon_{rtmn} = -2 * (\delta^{r}_{k} \delta^{t}_{s} - \delta^{r}_{s} \delta^{t}_{k})$$


# 2
In $\mathbb{R^2}$ let ($x^{\alpha}$) = (x , y) denote Cartesian and ($z^{\alpha}$) = (R , $\phi$) plane polar coordinates.

If the vector field X has components
($X^{\alpha}$) = (1 , 0) then find $z^{\alpha}$.

If $Y^{\alpha}=(0,1)$ find the $z^{\alpha}$.


If $Y^\alpha=(-y,x)$ then find the $z^{\alpha}$.




# 3
suppose spherical coordiantes {r,$\theta$,$\phi$}. Write down the change of coordinates from Cartesian coordinates to spherical polar coordinates. Obtain the transformation matrices $\dfrac {\partial x^\alpha}{\partial x'^\alpha}$, $\dfrac {\partial x'^\alpha}{\partial x^\alpha}$ expressing them both in terms of the primed coordinates.

consider $\mathbb{R^3}$ as a manifold with the flat Euclidian metric and coordinates {x,y,z}. Introduce spherical polar coordinates {r,$\theta$,$\phi$} related {x,y,z} by 
$$x = r sin \theta cos \phi$$
$$y = r sin \theta sin \phi$$
$$z = r cos \theta $$
that the metric takes the form
$$ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 sin^2\theta d\phi^2$$

A particle moves along a parameterized curve given by 
$$x(\lambda) = cos\lambda$$
$$y(\lambda) = sin\lambda$$
$$z(\lambda) = \lambda$$

Express the path of the curve in the {r,$\theta$,$\phi$} system


# 7
Consider the vector fields on $\mathbb{R^2}$
$$X = x \dfrac {\partial}{\partial x} + 2xy \dfrac {\partial}{\partial y}$$ $$Y = y \dfrac {\partial}{\partial y}$$
and let and let w be the differential one-form on $\mathbb{R^2}$ given by 

$$w=(x^2+2y)dx+(x+y^2)dy$$
show that w satisfies the relation 
$$dw(X,Y) = Xw(Y) - Yw(X) - w([X,Y])$$


# 6
In a 4 dimensional manifold with Minkowski metric, suppose $*F =q \sin(\theta) d\theta \wedge d\phi$.
prove d*F=*j.
please tell me more details and calculate every relations
