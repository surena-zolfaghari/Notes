# Amending older or multiple commit messages 
Created:2023-08-08 17-23

I created a commit, and now I want to change it's name (Note: this works only for latest commit)
```git
git commit --amend
```

To correct early commit you can follow this step:
```git
git rebase -i HEAD~i
```
now choose specific comment and replace pick before it with `reword` and save it. Then another page will be opened and it's there you can change your commit massage.
