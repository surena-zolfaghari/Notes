If you want to work on experimental project, It's better to work on a new branch. Follow this instructions:

There are two command for creating a branch. The first command creates a new branch but remain at the current branch. The second command creates a new branch and will switch to new branch.

```git
git branch < name of branch that you want >
```
OR
```git
git checkout -b < name of branch that you want >
```

you can select the branches with:
```
git checkout <name of branch>
```
and you can access to list of branches with:

```
git branch
```

Now I want to work on test branch for this purpose should all of the file copy and move on to test branch 
```git
git add . 
git commit -m "Your massage"
git push origin < name of branch >
```


If you want to merge a branch to default branch. First of all you should to check out to default branch. And then you can use the below command:
```git
git merge < Name of your branch >
```


After merging two branches, you can delete the second branch. Because all of changes pushed to default branch. For this goal see below:
```git
git push origin :mybranch         (Deleting a remote branch)
git branch -d mybranch            (Delete a branch)
```
