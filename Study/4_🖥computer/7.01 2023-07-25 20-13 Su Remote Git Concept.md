Created:2023-07-25 20-13

Sending file to another folder or cloud storage is called remote git. You should opt a name for it. Origin is a name that you probably have seen, after creating new repository.
> Note: you can use git for multiple goals. you can git two folders and a remote git simultaneously, but you should define different name. you can access to previous name with below command.  

~~~
git branch -r
~~~

It give list of name that selected for remote.





## Problems
Sometimes you may change something on remote, but this changes didn't do on local. Also you may perform a reset to specific commit in local and not in remote (Note: If you use revert, the error won't happen). This means your remote is up respect to local. This situations causes an error. If you don't care about all of changes in local you can run:

~~~
git pull origin master
~~~

and if you care about these change you can use:
```
git push -f origin master
```
