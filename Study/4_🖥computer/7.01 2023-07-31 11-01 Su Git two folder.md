# HOW TO GIT TWO FOLDER TOGETHER?
I want to backup folder that named surena
```git
git init
git add .
git satus 
git commit -m "2 March"
```


Now go to folder that you want to backup this file (I named backup)
```git
git init
git remote add origin < path of surena >
```


Now  go to surena
```git
git remote add origin < path of backup >
```

Then go to backup

```git
git pull origin master
```


> <mark style="background: #2BE611A6;">Remember origin and master are not sacred names. For example if you picked origin and master for remote repository shared, and now you want this information shared with a folder in external storage or another folder, you should change these names.</mark> [[7.01 2023-07-25 20-13 Su Remote Git Concept#^9d9f63]]
