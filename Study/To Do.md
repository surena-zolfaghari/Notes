Lenny was sitting on a bar stool holding his head in his hands while his cell phone was opened to an email message. Art: Whatsa matter, Lenny? Too much beer milkshake? Lenny:Here, Art, take a look at this email. I get a couple like it every day.


The answer to Art’s question is that we’re not doing Newton’s theory; we’re doing Einstein’s theory. Physics, including the laws of motion, force, and acceleration, all had to be rebuilt from the ground up, in accord with the principles of special relativity. We’re now ready to tackle that project. We will be especially interested in particle mechanics—how particles move according to special relativity. To accomplish this, we’ll need to corral a wide range of concepts, including many from classical mechanics. Our plan is to discuss each idea separately before knitting them all together at the end. Relativity builds on the classical notions of energy, momentum, canonical momenta, Hamiltonians, and Lagrangians; the principle of least action plays a central role. Though we offer some brief reminders of these ideas as we go, we assume you remember them from the first book of this series, The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics. If not, this would be an excellent time to review that material.
