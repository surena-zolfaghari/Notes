Diana finally arrives home after ageing 14 years. Knowing a little about time dilation, she expects Artemis to have aged much less, but to her surprise Artemis is a white-haired grandmother, a full 50 years older! Diana keeps her surprise to herself and runs over to the computer room to check out the data. She reads the dispatches from the graduate students riding the clocks of the outgoing frame. Sure enough, Artemis seems to have aged very slowly by their reports. At Diana’s time t  ̄ = 7yr, the graduate student passing Earth recorded that Earth’s clocks read only slightly less than two years of elapsed time. But then Diana checks the information from her graduate students riding the clocks of the ingoing frame. She finds that at her time t  = 7 yr, the graduate student reported a reading of Earth’s clocks at more than 48 years of elapsed time! How could one student see Earth to be at t = 2 yr, and another student, at the same time, see it at t = 48 yr? Diana leaves the computer room muttering about the declining standards of undergraduate education today. We know the mistake Diana made, however. Her two messengers did not pass Earth at the same time. Their clocks read the same amount, but they encountered Earth at the very different events A and C. Diana should have asked the first frame students to continue recording information until they saw the second frame’s t = 7 yr student pass Earth. What
