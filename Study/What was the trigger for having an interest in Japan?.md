My acquaintance with Japan began during my undergraduate years in mathematics. In the physics department, sessions were held to explain physics theory in simple language, and I sometimes attended them. when I first encountered the work of Hideki Yukawa, whose Meson theory revolutionized particle physics.  In this meetings as a mathematics student, Yukawa’s blend of mathematical rigor and physical insight captivated me. This academic curiosity grew stronger during my M.Sc. in physical oceanography at the University of Tehran, as I was researching and reading news in physics, often encountering references to Japan’s cutting-edge facilities like RIKEN and the Kamioka Observatory. I found out the Japan is symbolize the kind of physics, that I want to pursue: precise, innovative, and deeply theoretical.

Beyond the equations, Japan’s culture captured my heart in ways I hadn’t expected. One day, I picked up The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa from a local bookstore, drawn to its quiet cover. The story of a mathematician with a fading memory, connecting with his housekeeper and her son through the timeless language of numbers, moved me profoundly. As an Iranian, I saw echoes of my own culture’s reverence for storytelling and human bonds in the novel’s tender exploration of memory and connection. It painted Japan as a place where even the ordinary—a housekeeper’s care, a baseball game—could feel profound, and it left me eager to explore more of its literature and ethos.







Learning about Japan’s contributions to quantum mechanics—through scientists like Yukawa and later Makoto Kobayashi—sparked my admiration for a country that seemed to nurture such groundbreaking ideas.
