2. The Lagrangian density for a point particle of mass $m$ moving on a world line $z^\alpha(\lambda)$ is given by
$$
\mathscr{L}=-m \int \sqrt{-g_{\alpha \beta} \dot{z}^\alpha \dot{z}^\beta} \delta_4(x, z) \mathrm{d} \lambda,
$$
(a) Derive an expression for the stress-energy tensor of a point particle. To simplify this expression, set $\mathrm{d} \lambda=\mathrm{d} \tau$ (with $\tau$ denoting proper time on the world line) at the end of the calculation.

(b) Prove that when it is applied to a point particle, the statement $T_{; \beta}^{\alpha \beta}=0$ gives rise to the geodesic equation for $u^\alpha=\mathrm{d} z^\alpha / \mathrm{d} \tau$.
(c) Explain whether the result of part (b) constitutes a valid proof of the statement that the Einstein field equations predict the motion of a massive body to be geodesic.
