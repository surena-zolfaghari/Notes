3. In this problem we consider a spherically symmetric space at a moment of time symmetry. We write the three-metric as
$$
\mathrm{d} s^2=\mathrm{d} \ell^2+r^2(\ell) \mathrm{d} \Omega^2,
$$
where $\ell$ is proper distance from the centre.
(a) Show that in these coordinates, the mass function introduced in Section 3.6 .5 is given by
$$
m(r)=\frac{r}{2}\left[1-(\mathrm{d} r / \mathrm{d} \ell)^2\right]
$$

Hypersurfaces
(b) Solve the constraint equations for a uniform mass density $\rho$ on the hypersurface. Make sure to impose the asymptotic condition $r(\ell \rightarrow 0) \rightarrow \ell$ to force the three-metric to be regular at the centre.
