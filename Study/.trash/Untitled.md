Certainly! Let’s find the Green function for the Dirichlet problem inside a sphere.

The Green function for the Dirichlet problem inside a sphere of radius (a) can be expressed as:

$$G(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_0) = \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_0|} - \frac{a}{r} \frac{|\mathbf{x}_0 - (a^{2/r}2)\mathbf{x}|}{|\mathbf{x}_0|}$$


where:

$(\mathbf{x})$ represents the observation point inside the sphere.
$(\mathbf{x}_0)$ represents the source point (located on the sphere’s surface).
$(r)$ is the distance between ($\mathbf{x}$) and ($\mathbf{x}_0$).

This Green function satisfies the Dirichlet boundary condition, which specifies the potential on the sphere’s surface. It provides a solution for the Laplace equation within the sphere when given appropriate boundary conditions.

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask!

The Green's function for the Dirichlet problem inside a sphere can be given as³:

$$
G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') = \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} -\mathbf{x}'|} - \frac{a}{|\mathbf{x}'|} \left|\mathbf{x} - \frac{a^2}{|\mathbf{x}|^2}\mathbf{x}'\right|
$$

Here, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}'$ are the position vectors of the source and field points respectively, and $a$ is the radius of the sphere¹³. This Green's function satisfies the boundary conditions of the Dirichlet problem, which are that the potential is specified on the boundary of the domain¹².

The electrostatic potential within the domain can be written as¹:

$$
\Phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{x}') G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') d^3\mathbf{x}' + \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \oint_S \Phi(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\partial G(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')}{\partial n'} da'
$$

Here, $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$ is the charge distribution within the sphere, $\Phi(\mathbf{x}')$ is the potential on the surface of the sphere, and the potential at infinity is assumed to be zero¹. The integral over $V$ represents the contribution from the volume charges, and the integral over $S$ represents the contribution from the surface charges¹.
