The Lagrangian density for the free electromagnetic field is
$$
\mathscr{L}=-\frac{1}{16 \pi} F^{\alpha \beta} F_{\alpha \beta},
$$
where $F_{\alpha \beta}=A_{\beta ; \alpha}-A_{\alpha ; \beta}$ is the Faraday tensor, expressed in terms of the vector potential $A_\alpha$.
(a) Derive the Maxwell field equations in vacuum, $F_{; \beta}^{\alpha \beta}=0$, on the basis of this Lagrangian density.
(b) Show that the stress-energy tensor for the electromagnetic field is given by
$$
T_{\alpha \beta}=\frac{1}{4 \pi}\left(F_{\alpha \mu} F_\beta^\mu-\frac{1}{4} g_{\alpha \beta} F^{\mu \nu} F_{\mu \nu}\right) .
$$
