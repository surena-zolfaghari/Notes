in particular, they are antisymmetric. If we let µ and ν run over 0, 1, 2, 3, we get 16 matrices
altogether. We can think of these matrices as constituting an antisymmetric, 4 × 4 “tensor” of
antisymmetric matrices, much as J i constitutes a “vector” of matrices. Since this “tensor” is anti-
symmetric, that is, A µν = −A νµ , four of these matrices vanish and the remaining twelve consist of
six pairs that are equal and opposite. We see that there are only six linearly independent matrices
A µν , which we get by restricting µ and ν to the range 0 ≤ µ < ν ≤ 3.
Thus a given antisymmetric matrix, such as gC in Eq. (55), can be written as a linear combi-
nation of the six independent matrices A µν with coefficients that we will call θ µν :
