## Week 1
neuron implements this functions in that drew on the picture.

Rectified linear unit (ReLU):
Rectify just means taking a max of 0 which is why you get a function shape like this. Circle in below is neuron. And all construction is single neuron neural network.

For example $E$ only depends on $A, B$ ($E$ can be calculated by two inputs. but, we don't say this. We say calculate $E$ with all of inputs.

### Supervised Learning with Neural Networks

CNN: Convolutional neural networks are often used for image data


Recurrent Neural Network for sequence data like audio has a temporal component 
just talked about methods of supervised learning.





### Why is Deep Learning taking off?
