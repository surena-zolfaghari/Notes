- Superposition 
- Entanglement

Linear Operator 

$$L U = 0$$
$$ L \equiv  Linear \; operator$$
$$L(\alpha u)=\alpha U \; L(U+W)=LU+LW$$
and $U$ is what I want to find.
Now assume we found $U = U(t,x,...)$ and really does it relevant to position? No, for an electron you locked on in position you want to understand its physics, The position is not relevant. 

## Is Newtonian equation a linear equation?

No, remember the famous problem about three particles. And you could get this result mathematically. Suppose $V(x)$ is an arbitrary potential, you can recast newton's law
$$m \frac {d^2x}{dt^2} = -V'(x)$$
left side is linear but due to $V(x)$ is arbitrary, it is not necessarily $V(x+y) = V(x) + V(y)$.

## Photons are wave or particles?
Wave come up from Maxwell equations.
Einstein claimed they are particles. $$E = \hbar \nu \; \;\;\; \nu\lambda=c$$
If send light in $x$ direction; frequency and wave lenght doesn't change. 
$$E_{\alpha} = E_{0}\cos \alpha \; \hat{x} + E_{0}\sin \alpha \; \hat{y}$$
After plorizer:
$$E_{\alpha} = E_{0}\cos \alpha \; \hat{x}$$
Energy on electromagnetic field  $\propto \;  |E|^2$ and here $\propto \cos^2{\alpha}$
It can not possible go through half of photon because if half of it go through, then it's energy half of it, and color would change. And we know doesn't occur. This after plorization sed 1 billion photon to hole. Some fraction will go through and $1 - \cos^2\alpha$ doesn't. **Now notice**

If you send one billion
