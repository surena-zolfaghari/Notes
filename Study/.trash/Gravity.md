We know an arbitrary Lorentz transformation, denoted by $\Lambda$ can be decomposed into a boost with parameter $\vec{\beta}$ and a rotation with rotation angle $\phi$ around $\vec{n}$ $$\Lambda = L(\vec{\beta})R(\vec{n}\phi)$$
Show that the $\Lambda$ components are given by:
$$\gamma=\Lambda_0^0 \; \; -\gamma \beta^i=\Lambda_0^i \;\; -\gamma \beta_j R^j_i =\Lambda_i^0$$
and the three boost parameters are thus determined by the first column of $\Lambda$
$$\beta^i=$$

Certainly! Here's the explanation in Markdown format with inline formulas:

To show that a vector B can be orthogonal to a timelike vector A only if B is spacelike, we need to use the properties of vector inner products and the definition of timelike and spacelike vectors in the context of special relativity.

In special relativity, the inner product (also called the Minkowski metric) of two four-vectors A and B is defined as:

$$A \cdot B = g_{\mu \nu} \cdot A^\mu \cdot B^\nu$$

where $$\mu$$ and $$\nu$$ are indices that run from 0 to 3, and $$g_{\mu \nu}$$ is the metric tensor of Minkowski spacetime. The metric tensor for Minkowski spacetime is given by:

$$g_{\mu \nu} = \text{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1)$$

Now, let's consider the definition of timelike and spacelike vectors in special relativity:

1. A timelike vector is a four-vector for which $$A \cdot A > 0$$.
2. A spacelike vector is a four-vector for which $$A \cdot A < 0$$.

We want to show that if A is a timelike vector, then B can be orthogonal to A only if B is spacelike, which means that $$B \cdot A = 0$$.

Let's assume that B is orthogonal to A, so $$B \cdot A = 0$$. We can use the definitions and the inner product expression to prove the statement:

$$0 = B \cdot A = g_{\mu \nu} \cdot B^\mu \cdot A^\nu$$

Now, we know that $$g_{\mu \nu} = \text{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1)$$, so $$g_{00} = 1$$, and $$g_{ij} = -1$$ for $$i, j = 1, 2, 3$$. The only non-zero term in the sum for $$B \cdot A$$ will be the $$g_{00}$$ term because the $$g_{ij}$$ terms will contribute negatively to the sum.

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

$$0 = B^0 \cdot A^0$$

Since A is a timelike vector, $$A \cdot A > 0$$, so $$A^0 \cdot A^0 > 0$$. As a result, $$B^0$$ must be equal to 0 for the equation to hold. This implies that $$B^0 = 0$$, which means the time component of B is zero. Since the only non-zero component of B that can make $$B \cdot A = 0$$ is $$B^0$$, we conclude that B is spacelike, as its time component is zero.

So, if B is orthogonal to a timelike vector A, $$B^0$$ must be zero, and B is spacelike.
