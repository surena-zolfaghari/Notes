3. Calculate the gravitational action $S_G$ for a region $\mathscr{V}$ of Schwarzschild spacetime. Take $\mathscr{V}$ to be bounded by the hypersurfaces $\Sigma_{t_1}, \Sigma_{t_2}, \Sigma_R$, and $\Sigma_\rho$, where $\Sigma_{t_1}\left(\Sigma_{t_2}\right)$ is the spacelike hypersurface described by $t=t_1\left(t=t_2\right)$, and where $\Sigma_R\left(\Sigma_\rho\right)$ is the three-cylinder at $r=R(r=\rho)$. Here, $2 M<\rho<R$. At the end of the calculation, take the limits $R \rightarrow \infty$ and $\rho \rightarrow 2 M$.
