## Advanced introduction to General Relativity

**In Special Relativity** $g_{\mu \nu}=\eta_{\mu \nu}$ Minkowski metric: 


**In GR** All components of g are variable and depend on how much energy and momentum is in the local region.

**Linear algebra + Multivariable calculus**

* Tensor calculus
* Basis vector
* Partial derivative

**Directional derivative**

* <span class="math-inline">V\_f</span> is a directional derivative
* <span class="math-inline">V\_f\(R\)</span> is the change in R when we move a small distance in the direction of f

**Tensor calculus**

* Basis vector partial derivative

<span class="math-block">\\lim\_\{\\epsilon \\to 0\} \\frac\{R\(x \+ \\epsilon h\) \- R\(x, y\)\}\{\\epsilon\}</span>

**Polar coordinates**

* You can also express this in polar coordinates.

**Some text books = 48% = 8, My definition = 4B**

**IR is not normalized**

<span class="math-block">\\sqrt\{g\_\{\\alpha\\beta\} g^\{\\alpha\\beta\}\} \= 1</span>
