The right hand side is a number, but should be viewed as an operator (acting on any function it
multiplies by the number). This commutation relation can be used to prove Heisenberg’s uncer-
tainty principle, which states that the product of the position uncertainty and the momentum
uncertainty must always exceed ~/2.
The idea that operators can fail to commute may remind you of matrix multiplication, which
is also non-commutative. We thus have the following correspondences:
operators
↔ matrices
wavefunctions ↔ vectors
eigenstates
(2.14)
↔ eigenvectors
One can in fact formulate Quantum Mechanics using matrices, so these correspondences are
actually concrete and workable.
As an example of useful ma

In fact, one also has [σ 2 , σ 3 ] = 2iσ 1 and [σ 3 , σ 1 ] = 2iσ 2 .
Matrix mechanics, was worked out in 1925 by Werner Heisenberg and clarified by Max
Born and Pascual Jordan. Note that, if we were to write x̂ and p̂ operators in matrix form,
they would require infinite dimensional matrices. One can show that there are no finite size
matrices that commute to give a number times the identity matrix, as is required from (2.13).
This shouldn’t surprise us: on the real line there are an infinite number of linearly independent
wavefunctions, and in view of the correspondences in (2.14) it would suggest an infinite number
of basis vectors. The relevant matrices must therefore be infinite dimensional.
