The three components of spatial momentum P i together with the energy
P 0 form a 4-vector.
This has the important implication that the energy and momentum get mixed up
under a Lorentz transformation. For example, an object at rest in one frame has
energy but no momentum. In another frame the same object has both energy and
momentum.
Finally, th







# 3.5.3 An Example: Positronium Decay
Now that we know how to write down the energy of a massless particle, we
can solve a simple but interesting problem. There’s a particle called
positronium that consists of an electron and a positron in orbit around each
other. It’s electrically neutral and its mass is approximately the mass of two
electrons




We can now work out the Euler-Lagrange equations and find out how ϕ(t, x)
affects the motion of the particle. Rather than work out the full relativistic
equations of motion, we’ll look at the nonrelativistic limit where the particle
moves very slowly. That’s the limit in which the speed of light goes to infinity
—when c is far bigger than any other velocity in the problem. It’s helpful to
restore the constant c in our equations to see how this works. The modified
action integral is
$$\int dx$$

We can check this for dimensional consistency. The Lagrangian has units of
energy, and so does −mc 2 . I’ve multiplied ϕ(t, x) by a constant g, which is
called a coupling constant. It measures the strength by which the field affects
the motion of the particle, and we can select its units to guarantee that g times
ϕ(t, x) has units of energy. So far, g can be anything; we don’t know its value.
Both terms inside the square root are pure number
