# de Broglie's proposal

In 1924, the photon as a particle is clear, and the photon is also wave. de Broglie has a brilliant insight and said if this is supposed the photon is wave and particle. If they are dual-ed with respect to each other, the both descriptions are in different regime.

- wave attributes because it interferes and describe by wave
- Particle attributes because definite amount of energy it comes in packet, They cannot broken into other things.


He claimed that all matter particles behave as wave as well, not just photon. But that is quite interesting because in quantum mechanics you have the photon, and it's particle and now associated to a wave. In quantum mechanics, it's the probability amplitude.

wave of what? The answer came latter. They are wave of <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">probability amplitude</mark>.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{particle with} \\
&\text{momentum: } p
\end{aligned}
\quad
\xleftrightarrow{\hspace{1.5cm}}
\quad
\begin{aligned}
&\text{plane wave of} \;\lambda=\dfrac {h}{p} \text{(de Broglie 
wavelength)}
\end{aligned}
$$
# de Broglie wave length
Free particle with momentum $p$ associated to a plane wave with wavelength $\lambda=\dfrac {h}{p}.$ So this wave is what eventually becomes a famous wave function.

Directional properites


 $$\lambda \propto p$$
اگر دو ناظر گالیله ای این موج را ببینند طول موج های متفاوتی میبینند. این یک خاصیت عجیبه. چون برای موج‌های معمولی طول موج ثابته. 

# Galilean transformation
## Conclusion

- ** $\Psi$ are not directly measurable.**
Because if you had a quantity for which you could measure like a sound wave, they should agree between different observaber. $\Psi$  is not directly measurable<mark style="background: #55C5B2;"> not all of $\Psi$ can be measured some of $\Psi$ can be measured </mark>(9:28). And you are already heard the hints of that. Because we said any number that you multiply, you can not measure it, and in the phase that you multiply you can not measure it. So complex number can't be measured. you measure real number.

* **They are not Galilean invariant.**

If $S$ and $S'$ agreed, this wave function would have a simpler transformation law with a wave length this is conserve.

de Broglie waves are not like normal matter waves that propagate in a medium or simple.
