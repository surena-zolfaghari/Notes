Chimera states, which refer to the coexistence of synchronized and unsynchronized dynamical units, have been found to have a significant impact on brain dynamics. These states provide valuable insights into the functionality of the human brain and certain neurological disorders . The emergence of chimera states has been studied in various neural systems, including networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN) neurons and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons . It has been observed that the presence of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in neuronal networks increases the range of parameters displaying chimera states and prolongs their lifetime . Additionally, the relative abundance of chemical and electrical synapses in hybrid coupled neural systems affects the features of chimera states and different synchrony states . Furthermore, chimera states with multiple spatial scales have been observed in human cortical networks, suggesting a role in supporting diverse functional patterns in the brain.
