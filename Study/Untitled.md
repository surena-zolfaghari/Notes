question 2

The time-averaged potential of a neutral hydrogen atom is given by $\phi = \dfrac {q}{4 \pi\epsilon_0} \dfrac{\exp^{-\alpha r}}{k}(1+ \dfrac{\alpha r}{2})$ where q is the magnitude of the electronic charge, and $α^{−1} = a_0 /2$, $a_{0}$ being the Bohr radius. Find the distribution of charge
(both continuous and discrete) that will give this potential and interpret your result physically.

question 3

A Variation on Coulomb’s Law Suppose the electrostatic potential of a point charge were $V(r) =(1/4πϵ 0 )r −(1+ϵ)$ rather than the usual Coulomb formula.
