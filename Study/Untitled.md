our laws of physics, since it is tested every day in all the giant particle accelerators, which
send particles nearly to the speed of light.
Although the concept of relativity is old, it is customary to refer to Einstein’s theory sim-
ply as ‘relativity’. The adjective ‘special’ is applied in order to distinguish it from Einstein’s
theory of gravitation, which acquired the name ‘general relativity’ because it permits us to
describe physics from the point of view of both accelerated and inertial observers and is
in that respect a more general form of relativity. But the real physical distinction between
these two theories is that special relativity (SR) is capable of describing physics only in
the absence of gravitational fields, while general relativity (GR) extends SR to describe
gravitation itself. 4 We can only wish that an earlier generation of physicists had chosen
more appropriate names for these theories !
