question 2

The time-averaged potential of a neutral hydrogen atom is given by $\phi = \dfrac {q}{4 \pi\epsilon_0} \dfrac{\exp^{-\alpha r}}{k}(1+ \dfrac{\alpha r}{2})$ where q is the magnitude of the electronic charge, and $α^{−1} = a_0 /2$, $a_{0}$ being the Bohr radius. Find the distribution of charge
(both continuous and discrete) that will give this potential and interpret your result physically.

question 3

A Variation on Coulomb’s Law Suppose the electrostatic potential of a point charge were $V(r) =(1/4πϵ 0 )r −(1+ϵ)$ rather than the usual Coulomb formula.
Find the potential $V (r)$ at a point at a distance $r$ from the center of a spherical shell of radius $R > r$ with uniform
surface charge per unit area σ. Check the Coulomb limit $\epsilon=0$

 
 3(b)
 To first order in ϵ, show that
 $$\dfrac {V(R)-V(r)}{V(R)} = \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}[\dfrac{R}{r}\ln \dfrac{R+r}{R-r} - \ln \dfrac{4R^2}{R^2-r^2}]$$
 Since the time of Cavendish, formulae like this one have been used in experimental tests of the correctness of Coulomb’s law.
 
 

 great i want to copy this answer to tex file and then run in latex please give me an appropriate format
