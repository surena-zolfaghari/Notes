Suppose you know $\Psi(x, 0)$. How do I calculate $\Psi(x, t)$ ?
Step one: calculate $\Phi(k)$

$$
\Phi(k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int d x \;\Psi(x, 0) e^{-i k x}
$$

Step two: with this

$$
\Psi(x, 0)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int d k \;\phi(k) e^{i k x}
$$

Rewriting $\Psi(x, 0)$ which was an arbitrary function as a super position of plane waves.


Step three:$\quad \Psi(x, t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int d k \;\Phi(k) e^{i(k x-\omega(k) t)} \quad \hbar \omega(k)=\frac{\hbar^{2} k^{2}}{2 m}$
And I claim that just by writing this integral, I've solved Schrodinger equation. You can check it. Put $\Psi(x, t)$  $i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t}=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \frac{\partial^{2} \Psi}{\partial x^{2}}$

It's clear that we concentrate on $e^{i(k x-\omega(k) t)}$. And it solves this, because it is a plane wave. $\Psi(x, t)$ is a superposition of plane waves, Each of this plane wave solves the free Schrodinger equation.

Schrodinger equation is first order in time. If you know the wave function at one time, you get the wave function at any time.

If you put $t=0$ in solution, you get $\Psi(x, 0)$ that you wrote in step two. So it has the right condition. Not only solve the schrodinge equation, but it reduces to right thing.
