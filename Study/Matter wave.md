$\Psi$ can not be measured. You can also see this from superimposing[^1].
# de Broglie's proposal

In 1924, the photon as a particle is clear, and the photon is also wave. de Brogle has a brilliant insight and said if this is supposed the photon is wave and particle. If they are dual-ed with respect to each other, the both descriptions are in different regime.

- wave attributes because it interferes and describe by wave
- Particle attributes because definite amount of energy it comes in packet, They cannot broken into other things.


He claimed that all matter particles behave as wave as well, not just photon. But that is quite interesting because in quantum mechanics you have the photon, and it's particle and now associated to a wave. In quantum mechanics, it's the probability amplitude.

wave of what? The answer came latter. They are wave of <mark style="background: #FF2C61;">probability amplitude</mark>.
