**56**

algebra and say, oh, it’s 0? It’s kind of going to work that way but we’re going to do work and we’re going to get to \( \frac{dN}{dt} \) being integral of something. And it’s just not going to look like zero but it will be manipulated in such a way that you can argue it’s 0 using the boundary condition.

We need this for (4) be zero.

$$
\int (\hat{H} \psi)^* \psi = \int \psi^* (\hat{H} \psi) \tag{5}
$$

This would warranty $( \frac{dN}{dt} = 0 ) → ( N = cte ), ( N_t = 1 ). ( N = 1 )$.

(5) is true, if \( H \) is a Hermitian operator.  
A Hermitian $( \hat{H})$ would actually satisfy:

Condition of Hermiticity:  
$$
\int (\hat{H} \psi_1)^* \psi_2 = \int \psi_1^* (\hat{H} \psi_2) \tag{6}
$$

If $( \psi = \psi_2$), (6) gives (5).



\[
\int (\hat{H} \psi)^* \psi = \int \psi^* (\hat{H} \psi) \tag{5}
\]
