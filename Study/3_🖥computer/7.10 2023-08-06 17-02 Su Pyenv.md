I want to have many different Python versions. If you want such this, use Pyenv or virtualenv. My priority is Pyenv and if you need to configure a sub version, first use Pyenv and then use virtualenv.

```Shell
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```
## Commands
This command shows all of python versions.
```bash
pyenv install -l
```
After select the specific version:
```bash
pyenv install 3.9.10
```

> If you hit above command, it creates new version in `.pyenv` directory.


If you want to know which Python version is currently active in your shell, just type:
```bash
pyenv version
```

This command will list all the Python versions that you can choose from pyenv.
```bash
pyenv versions
```



<mark style="background: #2BE611A6;">Set a specific Python version to specific directory</mark>

To set a project Python version that is active as soon as you `cd` into the project directory, enter the following when you are inside of the projectâ€™s root directory:
```bash
pyenv local [PYTHON_VERSION]
```

If you want to set a specific Python version for your current terminal session, use:
```bash
pyenv shell [PYTHON_VERSION]
```
This will set the Python version only as long as your session is active. So after you close your terminal, everything is back to default.

After this process, you have to go VSCode and `Ctrl + Shift + p` to create `venv` and set your interpreter. For more information see [K0nze](https://k0nze.dev/posts/install-pyenv-venv-vscode/).
