Created:2024-01-02 14-45

install Zsh

```bash
sudo apt install zsh

```
Then go to MYZSh:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

```

# Change shell
To change shell to Zsh temporary 
```bash
exec zsh
```
To change permanently 
```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

To revert, it's enough replace `Zsh` to bash.
