with a general function $f(r)$ that needs to be determined via Einstein’s equations. Show that this metric will satisfy Einstein’s equations provided the the source energy-momentum tensor has the form

$$T^t_t=T^r_r=-\dfrac {\epsilon(r)}{8\pi G};\;\; T^\theta_\theta=T^\phi_\phi=- \dfrac {\mu(r)}{8\pi G} \tag{2}$$
Equation (2) also defines the functions $\epsilon(r)$ and $\mu(r)$.

Show that the Einstein equations now reduce to:
$$\dfrac {1}{r^2}(1-f)-\dfrac {f'}{f}=\epsilon \; ;\; \nabla^2=-2\mu$$

Given any $\epsilon(r)$, integrate the Eq. (3)
$$\dfrac {1}{r^2}(1-f)-\dfrac {f'}{f}=\epsilon \; ;\; \nabla^2=-2\mu \tag{3}$$
 to determine the solution to be
 $$f(r)1-\dfrac {a}{r}-\dfrac {1}{r} \int_a^r\epsilon(r)r^2dr$$
 with a being an integration constant chosen such that $f = 0$ at $r = a$ and $\mu(r)$ is fixed by $\epsilon(r)$ through
 $$\mu(r)=\epsilon+\dfrac {1}{2}r\epsilon'$$
