that Ψ is an eigenstate of p̂. The matrix algebra analogy is useful: matrices are the operators
and column vectors are the states. Matrices act by multiplication on column vectors. An
eigenvector of a matrix is a special vector. The matrix acting on an eigenvector gives a number
times the eigenvector. After the action of the matrix the direction of the vector is unchanged
but its magnitude can be scaled. The same for eigenstates of operators: an operator acting on
an eigenstate gives the eigenstate up to a multiplicative constant. We also say that Ψ is a state
of definite momentum.
Let us now consider extracting the energy information from the free particle wavefunction. This
time we must avail ourselves of the time derivative:


would seem plausible to say that the time derivative i~ ∂t
is an energy operator but, for a
free particle the energy is given in terms of the momentum, so we can construct the relevant
energy operator by working on the above right-hand side
