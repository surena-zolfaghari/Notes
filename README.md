## How to use it?
 
There are some folders:
 
Fleating notes: It's clear what it is.
Literature notes: It includes all of my notes about physics, mathematics, statistics and etc.
Permanent notes: It divides my notes to a particular subject. For example the notes that related to quantum mechanics are in quantum mechanics in permanent notes.
